**`Default`** Default Navigation buttons are used for navigation between pages that are not critical or emphasized. They typically represent inactive page states and support smooth movement across content.
Use case: Standard "next/previous" navigation in product listings or search results.

**`Strong`** The Strong Navigation button should be singular and prominent, reserved for highlighting the active page. It ensures the user always knows their current position within a sequence.
Use case: Highlighting the active page in long catalog navigation.

**`Brand`** A brand-colored alternative to the Strong Navigation button. It should be used sparingly for high-value navigation points or to visually anchor a brand moment. Avoid using it as the default for all pages.
Use case: Emphasizing a key page (e.g., a promotional offer) with the brand's primary color.

**`Minimal`** Minimal Navigation buttons are simplified and less emphasized, suitable when pagination is not the primary focus. They can be used independently or in combination with stronger buttons.
Use case: Secondary interfaces, such as blogs or FAQs, where pagination is less critical.
