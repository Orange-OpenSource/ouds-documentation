**Multiline**
This component allows multi-line text editing. Although the number of lines is not technically limited, it is recommended not to exceed one line of text.
Nevertheless, if the label spans multiple lines, the label remains horizontally centred and the chevron icon remains vertically centred.

**Max-width vs full-width**
For greater flexibility, this component doesn't have a default max-width. To avoid exceeding a width that would degrade readability and the perception of a compact interactive element, we recommend applying **a max-width of around 360px.**
The component can also naturally wrap within the parent container (or the screen in a mobile use context for exemple) and use the full available width.
Please note that this behavior is not the default rule; it may be preferred if the template allows it (to improve user comfort or for better page structure/hierarchy).

**User zoom in/out**
The behavior of the text during user zoom in/out must follow a fundamental principle: the text must remain readable, accessible, and must never break the structure or lose information.
* The text must always scale proportionally with user zoom. Text resizing must never be blocked.
* Zooming must never cause text to be truncated or hidden. The component must expand vertically to allow line wrapping.
* The component's height and width must be flexible, never fixed, in order to automatically adapt its dimensions according to the level of zoom.
* In order to preserve the minimun interactive area during user zoom out, this component have a min-width and a min-height **of 48px**.
* Even if, the component has a max-height or a max-width for resizing control purposes, technically, during user zoom in, these limitations are not fixed but must be scalable in order to adapt to the user's zoom level.
* As the chevron icon is functional, it must follow the same rules as text.
