**`False`** When Icon only is set to false, the button displays both an icon and a text label. This makes the action more explicit and accessible, especially for new users or in contexts where clarity is critical.
Use case: Using a "Next" button with both text and icon in a multi-step checkout flow to ensure the action is clearly understood.

**`True`** The Icon only Navigation button is used in layouts where space is limited or where a minimalist design is required. It relies solely on universally recognized icons (such as arrows) to indicate navigation actions without additional text. This variant should be applied selectively — for example in carousels, mobile navigation bars, or compact toolbars — where the context makes the meaning obvious. To ensure accessibility, it must always be paired with a hidden text label (via aria-label or tooltip) so that assistive technologies can convey the action clearly.
