✅ **Do:** Use only one Strong or Brand variant per pagination group to indicate the active or primary action clearly.  
❌ **Don't:** Apply Strong or Brand appearance to all navigation buttons, which eliminates visual hierarchy and confuses users.

✅ **Do:** Reserve the Brand variant for high-value moments that align with marketing goals or brand emphasis.  
❌ **Don't:** Use the Brand variant as a default replacement for Strong, as it dilutes brand impact when overused.

✅ **Do:** Use Default appearance for standard next/previous controls that don't require special emphasis.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix multiple strong visual variants in a single navigation group, creating competing focal points.

✅ **Do:** Choose Minimal appearance for secondary contexts where pagination shouldn't dominate the interface.  
❌ **Don't:** Use Minimal variants in critical navigation flows where clear affordance is essential for task completion.

✅ **Do:** Maintain consistent appearance choices within a single pagination pattern or component instance.  
❌ **Don't:** Switch appearance variants dynamically based on hover or interaction states—appearance should remain stable.
