✅ **Do:** Always provide an accessible name via `aria-label` or visually hidden text for icon-only buttons.  
❌ **Don't:** Use icon-only buttons without accessible labels, which makes them meaningless to screen reader users.

✅ **Do:** Use icon-only variants only when the navigation context is abundantly clear from surrounding interface elements.  
❌ **Don't:** Default to icon-only in unfamiliar contexts where users may not understand the arrow's meaning.

✅ **Do:** Include tooltips on hover for icon-only buttons to provide additional context for sighted users.  
❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on tooltips for accessibility—they don't help keyboard or screen reader users effectively.

✅ **Do:** Prefer icon+label buttons for critical navigation actions like checkout progression or form submissions.  
❌ **Don't:** Use icon-only variants in high-stakes flows where misclicks could cause data loss or frustration.

✅ **Do:** Ensure icon-only buttons have adequate touch target size (minimum 44×44px) for mobile accessibility.  
❌ **Don't:** Reduce icon-only button size below recommended minimums, which creates usability barriers on touch devices.
