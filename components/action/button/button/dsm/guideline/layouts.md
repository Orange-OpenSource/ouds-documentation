**`Text only`** This is the default layout of the component.

**`Text + icon`** This option includes functionality to choose any Solaris icon.
Its use must be restricted and remain specific to certain clearly identified contexts (e.g., the use of an icon within a "Play" button is standard in the context of TV or video streaming).

**`Icon only`** Typically utilized in business or back-office interfaces, it is rarely standalone (usually part of a group of elements).
