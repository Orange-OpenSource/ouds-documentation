✅ **Do:** Use only one Strong or Brand button per view to establish a clear visual hierarchy and guide users to the primary action.  
❌ **Don't:** Place multiple high-emphasis buttons together, which confuses users about which action is most important.

✅ **Do:** Reserve Negative buttons exclusively for destructive actions like "Delete" or "Remove" that require user awareness of consequences.  
❌ **Don't:** Use Negative styling for cancel actions or secondary dismissals that aren't truly destructive.

✅ **Do:** Pair Default (outline) buttons with Strong buttons to create clear primary/secondary action relationships.  
❌ **Don't:** Use Minimal buttons for important actions that users might miss due to low visual prominence.

✅ **Do:** Use Brand buttons sparingly for specific brand moments or high-value marketing actions to maintain their impact.  
❌ **Don't:** Use Brand buttons as the default primary throughout the interface, which dilutes brand emphasis.

✅ **Do:** Match button appearance to action importance—Strong for primary, Default for secondary, Minimal for tertiary.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix visual hierarchies inconsistently across similar workflows, creating unpredictable user experiences.
