✅ **Do:** Use the "On colored bg" variant when placing buttons over images, gradients, or brand-colored backgrounds where contrast cannot be guaranteed.  
❌ **Don't:** Use standard button variants on unpredictable backgrounds where they may fail contrast requirements.

✅ **Do:** Apply inverted colors consistently—black finish in light mode and white finish in dark mode—to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix inverted and non-inverted buttons on the same colored background, creating visual inconsistency.

✅ **Do:** Test button contrast against all possible background variations, including images with varying light and dark areas.  
❌ **Don't:** Assume a single static color variant will work across dynamic or user-generated background content.

✅ **Do:** Consider adding subtle shadows or overlays behind buttons on complex backgrounds to improve legibility.  
❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on color inversion when background complexity requires additional visual separation techniques.

✅ **Do:** Verify that focus states and hover states also maintain sufficient contrast on colored backgrounds.  
❌ **Don't:** Forget to test interactive states, which may reveal contrast issues not visible in the enabled state.
