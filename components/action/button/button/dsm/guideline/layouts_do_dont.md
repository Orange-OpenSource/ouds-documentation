✅ **Do:** Use Text only as the default layout, as text labels provide the clearest communication of button actions.  
❌ **Don't:** Default to icon-only buttons when space allows for text labels, sacrificing clarity for aesthetics.

✅ **Do:** Provide an accessible name via `aria-label` for icon-only buttons and include tooltips to explain the action on hover/focus.  
❌ **Don't:** Use icon-only buttons without accessible labels, making them incomprehensible to screen reader users.

✅ **Do:** Place icons before text labels (leading position) to maintain reading flow and visual consistency.  
❌ **Don't:** Position icons after text unless specifically indicating direction (e.g., "Next →") or external links.

✅ **Do:** Use icons that universally reinforce the action meaning, such as a trash icon for delete or download icon for download.  
❌ **Don't:** Add decorative icons that don't enhance understanding of the button's purpose.

✅ **Do:** Reserve icon-only buttons for well-established, universally recognized actions like close (×), settings (⚙), or search (🔍).  
❌ **Don't:** Use icon-only buttons for complex or ambiguous actions that require text explanation.
