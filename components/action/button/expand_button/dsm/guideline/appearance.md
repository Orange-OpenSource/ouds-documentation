**`Default`** Default expand buttons are used for standard interactions where expanding or collapsing content does not require strong emphasis. They provide a balanced and neutral look suitable for most layouts.
Use case: Expanding FAQ sections or showing additional text in articles.

**`Strong`** The Strong expand button is prominent and visually emphasized, reserved for the most important expandable sections where visibility and clarity are critical.
Use case: Expanding a key section in a form, such as "Payment details" in a checkout process.

**`Brand`** The Brand expand button uses the brand's primary color as an alternative to the Strong button. It should be used sparingly to anchor a branded moment or highlight a special section.
Use case: Expanding promotional or branded content blocks.

**`Minimal`** Minimal expand buttons are lightweight and understated, best for secondary or less critical expandable areas. They reduce visual noise and integrate seamlessly with simple layouts.
Use case: Expanding advanced options in a settings menu or filters in a search panel.
