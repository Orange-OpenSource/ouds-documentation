**`False`** The Icon only = false state displays both a text label and an icon. This version provides greater clarity and is recommended when users may need additional context to understand the button's action.
Use case: Expanding or collapsing sections in forms or settings, where descriptive text improves usability.

**`True`** The Icon only = true state displays only the icon without a visible label. It creates a more compact appearance, suitable for space-constrained layouts or when the icon meaning is universally understood. For accessibility, always provide an alternative text label via aria-label or a tooltip.
Use case: Expanding or collapsing filters, toolbars, or mobile panels where space is limited.
