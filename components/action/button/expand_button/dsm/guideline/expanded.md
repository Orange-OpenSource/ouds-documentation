**`False`** The Expanded = false state indicates that the content controlled by the button is currently hidden or collapsed. The button should visually suggest that more information is available (e.g., with a downward chevron).
Use case: Default state in FAQs, dropdowns, or collapsible panels before the user interacts with them.

**`True`** The Expanded = true state indicates that the content has been revealed or expanded. The button should update its visual affordance to show that the section is open (e.g., with an upward chevron) and that it can be collapsed again.
Use case: Active state when a user expands details, advanced options, or additional filters in a panel.
