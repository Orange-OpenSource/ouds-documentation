✅ **Do:** Limit nesting to a maximum of 2-3 levels to maintain readability and comprehension  
❌ **Don't:** Create deeply nested lists (4+ levels) that become difficult to scan

✅ **Do:** Use distinct visual markers at each nesting level for clear hierarchy differentiation  
❌ **Don't:** Use identical markers across nesting levels causing visual confusion

✅ **Do:** Ensure proper indentation spacing to clearly distinguish parent-child relationships  
❌ **Don't:** Use minimal indentation that makes hierarchy relationships unclear

✅ **Do:** Group related sub-items logically under their parent category  
❌ **Don't:** Nest unrelated items together just to reduce vertical space

✅ **Do:** Consider flattening deeply nested structures into separate lists with headings  
❌ **Don't:** Force complex hierarchies into a single nested list when sections work better
