An Expand filter chip is a compact UI component that combines the functionality of a filter chip with a dropdown menu. It allows users to apply a filter from a predefined list of options without leaving the current context. When activated, it reveals a dropdown containing selectable values, and the chip updates to reflect the selected filter. This component is useful for filters with multiple or dynamic options, offering both clarity and space efficiency in the interface.
