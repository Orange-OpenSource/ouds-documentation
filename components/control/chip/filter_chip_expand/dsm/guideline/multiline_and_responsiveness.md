**Multiline**
This component doesn't allows multi-line text editing. This is a design recommendation, technically, and for several reasons (responsive behavior, user zoom, etc.), multiline remains possible.

**Max-width vs full-width**
For greater flexibility, this component doesn't have a default max-width. To avoid exceeding a width that would degrade readability and the perception of a compact interactive element, we recommend applying **a max-width of around 200px.**
It is not possible to set this component to use the full available width (of the screen or the container).

**User zoom in/out**
The behavior of the text during user zoom in/out must follow a fundamental principle: the text must remain readable, accessible, and must never break the structure or lose information.
* The text must always scale proportionally with user zoom. Text resizing must never be blocked.
* Zooming must never cause text to be truncated or hidden. The component must expand vertically to allow line wrapping.
* The component's height and width must be flexible, never fixed, in order to automatically adapt its dimensions according to the level of zoom.
* In order to preserve the minimun interactive area during user zoom out, this component have a min-width **of 52px** and a min-height **of 48px**.
* Even if, the component has a max-height or a max-width for resizing control purposes, technically, during user zoom in, these limitations are not fixed but must be scalable in order to adapt to the user's zoom level.
* As the tick and the chevron icon are functional, they must follow the same rules as text.
