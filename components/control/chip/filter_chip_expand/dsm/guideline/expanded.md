The "Expanded" state allows the filter chip to be dynamically edited via a dropdown component.

**`True`** When a Filter chip is in the "Expanded" state, it:
 - Displays a contextual dropdown containing a menu or controls to modify the associated filter values.
 - Remains visually attached to the source chip (often below or overlapping).
 - Allows the user to select multiple options or apply a new value.
The component can remain in the "Expanded" state until a user action (click or key press) closes it. Chevron icon points up.

**`False`** The "Collapsed" state is the default or "resting" state of the filter chip, in which it simply displays a filter value, without any visible complex interaction. Chevron icon points down.
