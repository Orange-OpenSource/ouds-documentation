A filter chip is a compact UI element used in a design system to represent a filter option that can be selected or deselected by the user. Filter chips allow users to refine content or data by applying one or more filters in a visually accessible and interactive way.

Purpose: Allows users to filter content by selecting or deselecting specific categories or attributes.
Behavior: Can be toggled on/off to refine displayed results. Selected chips remain visually distinct to indicate active filters.
