**Filter chip** is a UI element that allows to select or deselect an option within a series, and is commonly used to capture filtering decisions. Filter chip allows to filter content by being selected or deselected. It can be toggled "On" or "Off" to refine displayed results, and selected Filter Chips remain visually distinct to indicate active filters.
