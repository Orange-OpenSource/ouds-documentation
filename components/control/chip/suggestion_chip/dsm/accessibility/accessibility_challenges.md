Suggestion chips present unique accessibility challenges because they function as dynamic, contextual controls that appear based on user input. They must communicate their purpose, availability, and interaction patterns to all users while maintaining a compact visual footprint.

### Key Challenges
- Ensuring chips are discoverable and announced when they dynamically appear
- Communicating the suggestion's purpose and action clearly to screen reader users
- Providing sufficient touch targets and focus indicators within compact dimensions
- Managing focus when suggestions are dismissed or new suggestions appear

### Critical Success Factors
1. Each chip must have an accessible name that clearly describes its action (WCAG 4.1.2)
2. Keyboard users must be able to navigate and activate all chips (WCAG 2.1.1)
3. Focus indicators must be clearly visible with ≥3:1 contrast ratio (WCAG 2.4.7)
4. Dynamic suggestion updates should be announced to screen readers appropriately
