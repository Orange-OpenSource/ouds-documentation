A suggestion chip is a compact UI element used to present recommended or predictive options based on user input or context. Often found in search bars, forms, or messaging interfaces, suggestion chips help users quickly select from relevant suggestions. They are typically non-selected by default and can be tapped or clicked to apply the suggestion, streamlining user input and enhancing usability.
