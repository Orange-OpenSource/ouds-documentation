**`Text + icon`** Combines text with an icon to enhance clarity and recognition. Ideal when a visual cue helps reinforce the filter's meaning.

**`Text only`** Displays only text, offering a clean and minimalistic look. Best suited for category-based filters that do not require additional visual elements.

**`Icon only`** Uses only an icon, making it a compact option for limited space. Works well with universally recognized symbols, such as a heart for favorites or a checkmark for selection.
