## Definition

A suggestion chip is a compact UI element used to present recommended or predictive options based on user input or context. Often found in search bars, forms, or messaging interfaces, suggestion chips help users quickly select from relevant suggestions. They are typically non-selected by default and can be tapped or clicked to apply the suggestion, streamlining user input and enhancing usability.

## Layouts

**`Text + icon`** Combines text with an icon to enhance clarity and recognition. Ideal when a visual cue helps reinforce the filter's meaning.

**`Text only`** Displays only text, offering a clean and minimalistic look. Best suited for category-based filters that do not require additional visual elements.

**`Icon only`** Uses only an icon, making it a compact option for limited space. Works well with universally recognized symbols, such as a heart for favorites or a checkmark for selection.

**`Enabled`** The chip is active and available for interaction. It is displayed in its standard style without additional effects.

**`Hover`** The appearance of the chip changes when the cursor hovers over it. This includes a color change for the border and the chip's content.

**`Pressed`** The active state when the chip is being pressed. Accompanied by a color change in the content and border.

**`Disabled`** The chip is unavailable for interaction. It is visually represented with a muted color change in the content and border (reduced brightness and contrast).

**`Focus`** The state when the chip receives focus (e.g., during keyboard navigation). It features a triple contrasting border to indicate the active element.

**`Skeleton`** Displays a placeholder chip while the content is loading. It appears as a semi-transparent gray block without content.
