### Keyboard Support

1. `Tab` moves focus to the first empty digit field or the next field in the form; `Shift+Tab` moves backward.
2. Number keys (0-9) enter a digit in the focused field and automatically advance focus to the next empty field.
3. `Backspace` deletes the current digit and moves focus to the previous field; holding `Backspace` continues deleting backward.
4. Arrow keys (`Left`, `Right`) navigate between digit fields without changing values; `Home` jumps to first field, `End` to last field.
5. Each digit field receives a visible focus indicator with outline ≥2px and contrast ≥3:1 against the background.
