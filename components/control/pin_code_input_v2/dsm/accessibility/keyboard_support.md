### Keyboard Support

1. Press `Tab` to focus the first empty input field in the sequence; press `Shift+Tab` to move focus backward through fields.
2. Type a numeric digit (0-9) to fill the current field and automatically advance focus to the next empty field.
3. Press `Backspace` to clear the current field and move focus to the previous field if the current field is empty.
4. Press arrow keys (`ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`) to manually navigate between input fields without deleting content.
5. Provide a visible focus indicator with outline or border ≥2px and contrast ≥3:1 on the currently active input field.
6. Press `Enter` to submit the complete code once all fields are filled (if auto-submit is not enabled).
