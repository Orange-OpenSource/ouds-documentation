### Touch & Mobile

1. Provide touch targets ≥44×44px for each input field with spacing ≥8px between fields to prevent accidental touches.
2. Trigger numeric keyboard automatically using `inputmode="numeric"` or `type="tel"` to optimize for digit entry on mobile devices.
3. Support auto-advance between fields on digit entry to reduce the need for manual navigation taps.
4. Ensure the entire component remains visible when the mobile keyboard appears; adjust viewport scroll if necessary.
5. Support both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of functionality or field visibility.
