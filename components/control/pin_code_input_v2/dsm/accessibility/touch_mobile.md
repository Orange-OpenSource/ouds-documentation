### Touch & Mobile

1. Provide touch targets ≥44×44px (48×48 preferred) for each digit box with spacing ≥8px between boxes.
2. Trigger numeric keyboard automatically using `inputmode="numeric"` to streamline digit entry on mobile devices.
3. Support both portrait and landscape orientations; boxes must reflow or scale responsively without loss of functionality.
4. Ensure visible focus indicators remain perceivable on touch devices (outline ≥2px, contrast ≥3:1) when using external keyboards.
