### Touch & Mobile

1. Each digit field provides a touch target ≥44×44px with ≥8px spacing between fields for accurate tapping.
2. Use `inputmode="numeric"` to trigger the numeric keyboard on mobile devices, making digit entry faster.
3. Support both portrait and landscape orientations, maintaining field visibility and keyboard accessibility in both modes.
4. Ensure focus management works correctly with mobile keyboards, advancing to the next field after each digit entry.
