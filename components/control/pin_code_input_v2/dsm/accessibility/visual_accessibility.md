### Visual Accessibility

1. Text and digit content maintain contrast ≥4.5:1 against backgrounds; error messages and icons meet ≥4.5:1 contrast.
2. Digit field borders and focus indicators maintain ≥3:1 contrast against adjacent colors.
3. Error states use red borders plus error icon and text message, not relying on color alone to convey the error.
4. Support text resizing to 200% without loss of functionality; digit fields reflow to maintain usability.
5. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by avoiding auto-advance animations if reduced motion is preferred.
