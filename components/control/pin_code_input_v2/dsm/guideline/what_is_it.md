## What is it

A PIN code input is a specialized form field used to capture short, fixed-length numeric codes, typically for authentication or confirmation purposes, such as a 4, 6 or 8-digit personal identification number (PIN).

It is often presented as a series of individual input fields or boxes, each representing a single digit, to enhance readability and encourage accurate input.

This component must support smooth keyboard navigation (automatic focus shift, backspace handling), secure input masking if needed. It is commonly used in sensitive flows like login, verification, or transaction confirmation.
