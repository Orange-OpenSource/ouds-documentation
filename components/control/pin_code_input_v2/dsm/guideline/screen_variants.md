## Screen Variants

**Desktop**  
Standard 6-digit layout with auto-advance focus and visible keyboard indicators. Each box sized for comfortable mouse/keyboard interaction with clear focus rings.

**Tablet**  
Slightly larger touch targets (44×44px minimum) to accommodate finger input. Numeric keyboard triggered automatically; layout adapts to portrait/landscape without loss of functionality.

**Mobile**  
Full numeric keyboard on focus with `inputmode="numeric"`. Touch targets meet 48×48px preferred size; boxes stack or scale responsively to fit narrow viewports while maintaining readability.
