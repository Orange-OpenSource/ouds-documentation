### Initial Config

| Property | Default Value | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Outlined | False | Filled style provides better visibility in dense layouts; outlined reduces visual weight for non-form contexts. |
| Rounded corner | False | Square corners suit standard/business flows; rounded corners offer flexibility for brand-specific or emotional contexts. |
| Length | 6 | Six digits balances security and usability; adjust to 4 or 8 based on system requirements. |
| Error | False | Error state applies to all boxes simultaneously and cannot be assigned individually. |
| Helper text | Off | When enabled, displays the expected digit count (4, 6, or 8) to guide user input. |
