### Error

The Error status indicates that the user input does not meet validation rules or expected formatting. It provides immediate visual feedback, typically through a red border, error icon, and a clear, accessible error message positioned below the input (mandatory).

This state helps users quickly identify and correct mistakes by explaining what went wrong and, when possible, how to fix it. The input remains editable, encouraging users to revise their input without starting over.

The error state must be triggered by an explicit validation (submission, API response), and not in real time with each keystroke. This can occur either because the entered code does not match the expected code, because the user entered an expired or already used code, or finally if the maximum number of attempts has been exceeded.

⚠️ **Alert:** In the context of a PIN code input, in addition to the input's "Error" UI rendering, it is essential to also include an "Alert" component (also in its "Error" status) in the interface.
