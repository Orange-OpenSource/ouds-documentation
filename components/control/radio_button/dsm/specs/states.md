**`Enabled`** The default active state where the radio button is functional and selectable. It may show an unselected or selected style, with a label and helper text visible.

**`Hover`** When a user places a pointing device over a radio button, but has not yet taken action on it. This includes a subtle visual indicator (highlighted background or color change) to show interactivity.

**`Focus`** When a user selects a radio button via keyboard or voice command, but has not yet taken action on it. Mirrors the "Hover" state but includes an additional border.

**`Pressed`** An intermediate state that communicates a user has taken action on a radio button, and that it is in the process of navigating to a destination, triggering logic, or transmitting data.

**`Read only`** The radio button is displayed in a specific state (selected or unselected), but the user cannot modify it with a label and helper text visible.

**`Disabled`** The radio button is non-interactive and grayed out to indicate it cannot be selected or changed. The label and helper text are  muted.

**`Skeleton`** Improves the perceived loading time by providing a visual cue of where radio button will appear once fully loaded. Uses the "Skeleton" component, variant "Security marge=True".
