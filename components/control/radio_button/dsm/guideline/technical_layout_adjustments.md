Even though, in Figma, the component structure is unique (for easier use by designers), technically the versions differ in order to respect best practices for each environment (paradigm shift between the web "Container" vs. the native "Edge-to-Edge"):

**Web (mobile, tablet, and desktop)**
The component is contained within the browser window and has "safety margins." It therefore cannot appear in the area corresponding to the margin grid.
The component has internal padding-inline, and its display position must be between several columns (which varies depending on the number of containers used on a horizontal row).

**Native app (Android, iOS, Flutter)**
The display position of the component corresponds to the entire screen display area (edge to edge).
Its internal padding-inline is therefore replaced by the grid-margin tokens.

For a card-type display (Outlined=True), no adaptation is made; the component structure remains the same between web and native.
