A radio button is a user interface element that allows users to select a single option from a set of mutually exclusive choices, typically displayed as a circular input with a label that becomes filled when selected.

This component family is available in two variants:
• **Radio-button:** In this template, the component does not display any text or icon. This layout provides greater flexibility when creating other components that require a radio-button to be displayed.
• **Radio-button item:** In this template, the component displays multiple additional text elements and icon assets.
