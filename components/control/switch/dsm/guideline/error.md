**`False`** The switch is unselected or turned off, but this value is invalid. Used when a required action hasn't been completed or an active state is expected.

**`True`** The switch holds a value, but it does not meet logical or validation requirements. Used when the current state (on or off) causes a conflict or violates form rules.
