✅ **Do:** Use distinct visual cues (color, position, icon) to clearly differentiate between on and off states.  
❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on color to indicate the selected state—users with color blindness may not perceive the difference.

✅ **Do:** Position the cursor to the right of the track for "on" and left for "off" to match user expectations.  
❌ **Don't:** Invert the cursor position convention as this creates confusion about which state is active.

✅ **Do:** Apply the action immediately when the user toggles the switch without requiring a separate save action.  
❌ **Don't:** Use switches for actions that require confirmation or have significant consequences.

✅ **Do:** Display a checkmark icon inside the cursor when selected to reinforce the active state visually.  
❌ **Don't:** Add animation that delays the visual feedback of state change beyond 200ms.

✅ **Do:** Ensure the default state (usually off) makes sense for first-time users and respects privacy.  
❌ **Don't:** Pre-select switches in ways that may trick users into enabling unwanted features.
