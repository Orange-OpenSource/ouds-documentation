A switch is a component that allows the user to toggle between two states, typically "on" and "off." It is often represented as a button or a slider that changes position or color to indicate the current state. Switches are used to enable or disable features, options, or settings in an intuitive and visual manner. This component is available in two variants:
* **Switch:** Here, the component does not display any text or icon. This layout provides greater flexibility when creating other components that require a switch to be displayed.
* **Switch item:** Here, the component displays multiple additional text elements and icon assets.
