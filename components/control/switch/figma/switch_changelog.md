| Nov 7, 2025 | 1.5.0 | • A new Read-only variant has been added for the .Switch.Indicator component, supporting two boolean variants — Selected = True/False. This variant introduces two new color tokens: | Anton Astafev |
| | | ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ • ouds/color/action/read-only-primary | |
| | | ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ • ouds/color/action/read-only-secondary | |
| | | • The new Read-only variant has been integrated into the Read-only variant of both the Switch and Switch Item components. | |
| | | • We replaced the token in Error text container ouds-control-text-input-space-padding-block-top-helper-text with ouds-control-control-item-space-padding-block-top-error-text. | |
| | | • "Helper text" is now called "Description". | |
| Oct 20, 2025 | 1.4.0 | • The Switch item has been split into two boolean variants: → Error = True/False → Selected = True/False | Anton Astafev |
| | | • The divider color is now functional in the Error state — it changes dynamically according to the component status. | |
| | | • The icon in the Error state is fixed to .Component/alert/important; its color changes together with the divider depending on the component's status. → The new token $control-control-item-size-error-icon is used for the icon size. → The new token $control-text-input-space-padding-inline-error-icon is used for the error icon container. 🆕 Both tokens are now available in the latest release of the Token Library 2.1.0. | |
| | | • Added Error text (from the Input component) — it follows the same padding-inline as control-item (16px) and uses → $control-text-input-space-padding-block-top-helper-text for block padding. By default, the Error text adapts automatically to match the component status: → Selected → displays the corresponding default error message for the selected state. → Unselected → displays the corresponding default error message for the unselected state. | |
| | | • The "Read only" state will be updated with the goal of replacing the control items (in their "disabled" states), whether selected or unselected, with the component Tag → Text only → Muted: → Positive with a label text "Selected" if status selected=True → Negative with a label text "Unselected" if status selected=False | |
| | | • Harmonisation of spacing across the control-item family We've unified sizing tokens across the entire control-item family (previously they were defined per component) to align spacing with other control items such as Text input. Replacement note: instead of the single token padding inset 12, use the following tokens: → ouds/_control/control-item/space/padding-inline → 16 → ouds/_control/control-item/space/padding-block → 12 Additionally, for the control-item family: → ouds/_control/control-item/space/column-gap → 12 → ouds/_control/control-item/size/max-width → 480 | |
| Sep 19, 2025 | 1.3.0 | • In the initial settings, the 'Divider' variant is now hidden. | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Jul 21, 2025 | 1.2.0 | • The name of the family to which this component belongs is changing: Input → Control. As a result, the token naming convention is being updated. | Maxime Tonnerre |
| | | • Following the renaming of the 'Control' category, the name of the token sub-family 'control-item' is now becoming 'item'." | |
| Jun 16, 2025 | 1.1.0 | • Modification of the minimum height of the frame containing the component "Switch" to increase the interactive area (48px). Component token: $ouds-input-switch-size-min-height-interactive-area | Maxime Tonnerre |
| | | • Application of a border radius token to the "Focus" and "Focus inset" frames. The UI rendering of the focus state stroke of the component is now rounded like the rest of the component. Component token: $ouds-input-switch-border-radius-track | |
| | | • Application of a border radius token to the "Content" frame. The UI rendering of the skeleton state stroke of the component is now rounded like the rest of the component. Component token: $ouds-input-switch-border-radius-track | |
| Mar 6, 2025 | 1.0.0 | • Component creation | Jérôme Regnier |
