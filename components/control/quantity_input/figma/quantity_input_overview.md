## Definition

A quantity input is a form component that allows users to specify a numerical value representing a quantity, often used in contexts like shopping carts, inventory management, or booking systems. It typically combines a numeric text field with increment and decrement controls (such as "+" and "–" buttons) to make adjustments easy and precise. The component must enforce valid input ranges (minimum of 1), prevent invalid characters, and support keyboard input, stepper controls, and assistive technologies.

## Outlined

**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border, creating a softer and more contained look. Best suited for dense layouts or to enhance visibility.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and a visible stroke outlining the field. This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
• When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
• In a header (search field)
• In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog

---

## Rounded corner

**`False`** For a square finish.

**`True`** For a finish with rounded corner. To be favored in more emotional, immersive contexts or those tied to specific visual identities. For standard or business-oriented journeys, keep the default corners. This evolution addresses the need for flexibility in adapting the design to certain brand contexts.

---

### Input status

**`Empty`** The Empty state indicates that the quantity input is blank with no content or placeholder, a neutral starting point.

**`Empty (Placeholder)`** The Empty with Placeholder state provides a hint or guidance inside the field to suggest expected input.

**`Filled`** The Filled state shows that the user has entered valid content into the field, replacing any placeholder.

---

## Actions placement

**`Trailing`** It places both the increment and decrement buttons on the right side of the input field, either stacked vertically or positioned side by side. This layout is compact and visually streamlined, making it ideal for dense interfaces or mobile views.

**`Split`** It positions the decrement button to the left of the input and the increment button to the right. It provides a more balanced and intuitive interaction model, especially in use cases like e-commerce where users frequently adjust quantities.

---

## States

**`Enabled`** Neutral appearance, whether empty or filled. It allows users to click, focus, and type freely without restrictions.

**`Hover`** Slight visual contrast or border color change.

**`Focus`** The quantity input is focused and ready to receive user input. It visually highlights the field to indicate that it's currently editable and interactive. This state typically appears after a user clicks or taps into the field.

**`Loading`** The Loading state indicates that the system is processing or retrieving data related to the quantity input. A progress indicator appears to inform the user that an action is in progress. During this state, the input may be temporarily disabled to prevent further interaction.

**`Read only`** Text visible but not editable (often with a muted or different background).

**`Disabled`** The field is non-interactive and grayed out to indicate it cannot be changed. The helper text is muted.

**`Skeleton`** Improves the perceived loading time by providing a visual cue of where field will appear once fully loaded. Uses the "Skeleton" component, variant "Security marge=False".

## ⚠️ Specific focus state rules

**Keyboard input disabled**

In the vast majority of modern UX/UI cases, a quantity input should be editable on focus. However, there are a few specific rare cases where direct editing by keyboard input might be disabled:
• Highly guided or controlled usage→product configuration with mandatory steps
• Risk of critical error→specific or technical values
• Strict touch context→mobile app with simplified UI, no keyboard
• Deliberate product decision→to enforce navigation or a business constraint

In this specific context, it is therefore recommended to prefill the input by default.

**Keyboard input + increment/decrement controls enabled**

In the context of an editable quantity input, if the field is focused and already filled by the user, then clicking the + (increase) or – (decrease) buttons must follow a smooth and predictable behavior according to the following UX rules.

When clicking + or – during editing:
• The value is automatically validated
• The action is applied to that value (+1 or –1)
• The field is visually updated with the new value
• The cursor is moved to the end of the field (optional)
• The field remains focused

Absolutely to avoid:
• Losing the currently typed value if partially entered
• Requiring defocus for the buttons to work
• Failing to parse/validate the value before incrementing

Specific error focus state:
If the value in the field is invalid (empty or non-numeric), clicking + or – may:
• Either fill in a default value (1)
• Or display a temporary blocking error ("Please enter a number")

---

## Error

The Error status indicates that the user input does not meet validation rules or expected formatting. It provides immediate visual feedback, typically through a red border, error icon, and a clear, accessible error message positioned below the input (mandatory).

This state helps users quickly identify and correct mistakes by explaining what went wrong and, when possible, how to fix it. The input remains editable, encouraging users to revise their input without starting over.

If the input is filled, an "error" status is triggered by the entry of a value that is too small, too large, or non-numeric.

**⚠️ Error message vs helper text** The error message is not the same element as the helper text, it is independent. If a helper text accompanies the text input, it is replaced by the error message. The helper text must not be displayed simultaneously.

---

## Leading icon

Helps indicate the purpose of the input (magnifying glass for search, envelope for email, phone device for phone number). Only use a leading icon if it adds clear functional or contextual value.

---

## ⚠️ Label

Describes the purpose of the input. Why hide a quantity input label?
In some UI contexts, especially when space is limited or when the input is part of a compact layout (search bars, filters, inline forms), visually hiding the label can help maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.
However, hiding the label should only be done if:
• The purpose of the input remains clear thanks to a placeholder or contextual icon.
• The label is still accessible to screen readers (using aria-label, aria-labelledby, or visually hidden text).

Hiding a label is a design choice that must balance visual simplicity and clarity of intent, without compromising inclusiveness or form guidance.

## Other boolean options

**`Suffix`** An element placed after the user's input, often used to display a currency or a unit (kg, %, cm…).

**`Helper text`** Supporting text conveys additional information about the input field, such as how it will be used. It should ideally only take up a single line, though may wrap to multiple lines if required, and be either persistently visible or visible only on focus.
