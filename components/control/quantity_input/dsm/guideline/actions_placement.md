**`Trailing`** It places both the increment and decrement buttons on the right side of the input field, either stacked vertically or positioned side by side. This layout is compact and visually streamlined, making it ideal for dense interfaces or mobile views.

**`Split`** It positions the decrement button to the left of the input and the increment button to the right. It provides a more balanced and intuitive interaction model, especially in use cases like e-commerce where users frequently adjust quantities.
