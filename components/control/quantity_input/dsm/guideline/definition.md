Quantity input is a UI element that allows to specify a numerical value representing a quantity. Quantity input typically combines a numeric text field with increment and decrement controls (such as "+" and "–" buttons) to make adjustments easy and precise. It enforces valid input ranges (minimum of one), prevents invalid characters, and supports keyboard input, stepper controls, and assistive technologies.
