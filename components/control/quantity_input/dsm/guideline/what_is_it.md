## What is it

A quantity input is a form component that allows users to specify a numerical value representing a quantity, often used in contexts like shopping carts, inventory management, or booking systems. It typically combines a numeric text field with increment and decrement controls (such as "+" and "âˆ’" buttons) to make adjustments easy and precise. The component must enforce valid input ranges (minimum of 1), prevent invalid characters, and support keyboard input, stepper controls, and assistive technologies.
