The Error status indicates that the user input does not meet validation rules or expected formatting. It provides immediate visual feedback, typically through a red border, error icon, and a clear, accessible error message positioned below the input (mandatory).

This state helps users quickly identify and correct mistakes by explaining what went wrong and, when possible, how to fix it. The input remains editable, encouraging users to revise their input without starting over.

If the input is filled, an "error" status is triggered by the entry of a value that is too small, too large, or non-numeric.

**⚠️ Error message vs helper text** The error message is not the same element as the helper text, it is independent. If a helper text accompanies the text input, it is replaced by the error message. The helper text must not be displayed simultaneously.
