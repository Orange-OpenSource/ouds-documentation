**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border, creating a softer and more contained look. Best suited for dense layouts or to enhance visibility.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and a visible stroke outlining the field. This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
• When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
• In a header (search field)
• In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use the outlined variant for standalone inputs that need clear visual boundaries within content-heavy pages  
❌ **Don't:** Mix outlined and filled variants inconsistently within the same form or interface section

✅ **Do:** Apply the filled variant in dense form layouts where subtle background differentiation aids scanability  
❌ **Don't:** Use outlined style on dark backgrounds where the stroke may lack sufficient contrast

✅ **Do:** Consider the outlined variant for filter bars and search contexts where inputs appear inline with other controls  
❌ **Don't:** Default to outlined style without considering the overall visual density of the interface

✅ **Do:** Maintain consistent style choices across related quantity inputs within a single workflow  
❌ **Don't:** Switch between outlined and filled styles based solely on aesthetic preference without functional rationale

✅ **Do:** Test both variants with your actual content to determine which provides better visual hierarchy  
❌ **Don't:** Assume one style universally works better—context determines the optimal choice
