### Leading icon

This boolean property allows an icon to be displayed on the left side (leading side) of the input field, providing an additional visual cue or contextual indicator for the user.

When set to true, a decorative or functional icon appears at the start of the input. This could represent a category (such as a cart icon for a shopping cart), a unit type (such as a currency symbol for monetary input), or any other relevant visual hint that helps the user understand the context or purpose of the input field.

The leading icon does not replace the label but serves as a supplementary visual cue to reinforce the input's meaning or to make the interface more intuitive and visually engaging.
