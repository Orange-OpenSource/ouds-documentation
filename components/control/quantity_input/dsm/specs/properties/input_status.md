### Input status

**`Empty`** The input has not been interacted with yet, and no value (not even a placeholder) is displayed. Only the label is visible.

**`Empty (Placeholder)`** The input has not been interacted with yet and displays a placeholder text to guide the user on what to enter. The placeholder appears in a lighter color and disappears when the user starts typing.

**`Filled`** The input contains a value that has been entered by the user or pre-filled by the system. The filled state is the result of user interaction or a default value provided by the application.
