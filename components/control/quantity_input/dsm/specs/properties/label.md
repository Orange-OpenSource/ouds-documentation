### Label

Label is a required element that describes the purpose of the input field. It provides users with clear context about what information or value they are expected to enter.

**⚠️ Label (boolean property)**

Determines whether the label is visible in the component. When set to true, the label is displayed and provides users with clear guidance on what to enter. When set to false, the label is hidden, though this is not recommended from an accessibility standpoint. Even if the label is visually hidden, it should remain present in the code for screen readers and assistive technologies to ensure that all users understand the purpose of the input.

**✏️ Label (text property - editable)**

Allows you to customize the text content of the label. By default, the label may read something like "Quantity" or "Number of items," but you can edit it to match your specific use case, such as "Select quantity," "Number of tickets," or "How many items?". Providing a clear and descriptive label helps users understand exactly what they are expected to input, improving usability and accessibility.
