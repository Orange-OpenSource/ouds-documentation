### Other boolean options

**Suffix** Allows an optional suffix (such as a unit indicator like "kg," "pcs," or "items") to be displayed after the input field. This provides additional context to the user about the unit or type of value being entered.

**Helper text** Determines whether additional explanatory text is displayed below the input field. When enabled, the Helper text can provide extra guidance, tips, or clarification to help users understand how to use the input correctly (e.g., "Minimum quantity is 1" or "Select the number of items you wish to purchase").
