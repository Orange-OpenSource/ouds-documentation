### Actions placement

**`Trailing`** The increment and decrement action buttons are positioned on the trailing side (right in LTR languages, left in RTL languages) of the input field, both one above the other. This creates a condensed vertical layout that is consistent with the overall spatial hierarchy of the input field and keeps the entire component compact within a single inline flow.

**`Split`** The decrement button is positioned on the leading side (left in LTR languages, right in RTL languages), while the increment button is on the trailing side. This creates a horizontal arrangement that visually balances the input field. This layout visually resembles physical controls or product detail pages.
