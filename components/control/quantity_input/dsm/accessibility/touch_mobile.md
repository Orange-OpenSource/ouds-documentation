## Touch & Mobile

1. Ensure increment and decrement buttons meet minimum touch target size of 44×44px (48×48px preferred).
2. Provide spacing of ≥8px between buttons and other interactive elements to prevent accidental taps.
3. Use `inputmode="numeric"` to trigger the numeric keyboard on mobile devices for efficient entry.
4. Support both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of functionality or content reflow issues.
5. Consider larger button sizes and spacing on mobile to accommodate finger-based interactions.
