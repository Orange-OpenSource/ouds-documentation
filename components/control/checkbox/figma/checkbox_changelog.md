| Nov 7, 2025 | 2.4.0 | • A new Read-only variant has been added for the .Checkbox.Indicator component, supporting three states — Selected, Unselected, and Indeterminate. This variant introduces two new color tokens: • ouds/color/action/read-only-primary — used for the indicator (shape) • ouds/color/action/read-only-secondary — used for the stroke • The new Read-only variant has been integrated into the Read-only variant of both the Checkbox and Checkbox Itemcomponents. • We replaced the token in Error text container ouds-control-text-input-space-padding-block-top-helper-text with ouds-control-control-item-space-padding-block-top-error-text. • "Helper text" is now called "Description". | Anton Astafev |
| Oct 20, 2025 | 2.3.0 | • The "Selection status" variant has been restructured from six options (Selected / Selected error / Unselected / Unselected error / Indeterminate / Indeterminate error) into three base variants: → Selected → Unselected → Indeterminate • Each variant now includes a boolean property to control the Error state (Error = True/False). • The divider color is now functional in the Error state — it changes dynamically according to the component status. • The icon in the Error state is fixed to .Component/alert/important; its color changes together with the divider depending on the component's status. → The new token $control-control-item-size-error-icon is used for the icon size. → The new token $control-text-input-space-padding-inline-error-icon is used for the error icon container. 🆕 Both tokens are now available in the latest release of the Token Library 2.1.0. • Added Error text (from the Input component) — it follows the same padding-inline as control-item (16px) and uses → $control-text-input-space-padding-block-top-helper-text for block padding. By default, the Error text adapts automatically to match the component status: → Selected → displays the corresponding default error message for the selected state. → Unselected → displays the corresponding default error message for the unselected state. → Indeterminate → displays the corresponding default error message for the indeterminate state. • The "Read only" state has been updated to replace disabled control items with the Tag → Text only → Mutedcomponent: → Positive with label "Selected" → Negative with label "Unselected" → Caution with label "Indeterminate" • Harmonisation of spacing across the control-item family We've unified sizing tokens across the entire control-item family (previously they were defined per component) to align spacing with other control items such as Text input. Replacement note: instead of the single token padding inset 12, use the following tokens: → ouds/_control/control-item/space/padding-inline → 16 → ouds/_control/control-item/space/padding-block → 12 Additionally, for the control-item family: → ouds/_control/control-item/space/column-gap → 12 → ouds/_control/control-item/size/max-width → 480 | Anton Astafev |
| Sep 19, 2025 | 2.2.0 | • In the initial settings, the 'Divider' variant is now hidden. | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Jul 21, 2025 | 2.1.0 | • The name of the family to which this component belongs is changing: Input → Control. As a result, the token naming convention is being updated. • Following the renaming of the 'Control' category, the name of the token sub-family 'control-item' is now becoming 'item'." | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Fev 13, 2025 | 2.0.0 | • Restructuring the component to optimize its factoring. • Creation of the nested component ".CheckboxItem.Control." • The component is now divided into two distinct components: • Checkbox • Checkbox item | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Jan 17, 2025 | 1.0.0 | • Component creation | Maxime Tonnerre |
