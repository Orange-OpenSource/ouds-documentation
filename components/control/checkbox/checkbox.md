# Guideline

## Intro

A checkbox allows users to select or deselect one or more options from a set independently.

---

## Definition

A checkbox component is a user interface element used to allow the user to selection-control or deselection-control an option. It is commonly used in forms, web interfaces, or applications to capture multiple or single choices.

This component family is available in two variants:
• **Checkbox:** In this template, the component does not display any text or icon. This layout provides greater flexibility when creating other components that require a checkbox to be displayed.
• **Checkbox item:** In this template, the component displays multiple additional text elements and icon assets.

---

## Best for

✅ Selecting multiple options from a list where choices are not mutually exclusive

✅ Accepting terms, conditions, or consent agreements requiring explicit user acknowledgment

✅ Filtering content in tables, lists, or search results

✅ Batch-selecting items for bulk actions like delete, move, or export

✅ Creating parent-child hierarchical selections with indeterminate state support

✅ Toggling feature settings that require form submission to take effect

✅ Collecting survey responses where multiple answers apply

✅ Enabling optional add-ons or features during checkout or configuration flows

✅ Building preference panels with independent on/off choices

✅ Confirming understanding of important information before proceeding

## Anatomy 👈🤖

| # | Element | Purpose | Optional |
|---|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Checkbox indicator | Visual control showing selected, unselected, or indeterminate state | N |
| 2 | Label | Text describing the option being selected | N |
| 3 | Description | Additional helper text providing context for the option | Y |
| 4 | Icon | Visual element supporting the label meaning | Y |
| 5 | Divider | Horizontal line separating checkbox items in a group | Y |
| 6 | Error icon | Alert indicator shown when validation fails | Y |
| 7 | Error message | Text explaining what went wrong and how to fix it | Y |

## Selection status

**`Selected`** Indicates that the user has selected the option.
This often corresponds to an action or validation.

**`Unselected`** By default, a checkbox is often in this state.
This state indicates that the user has not selected the associated option.

**`Indeterminate`** Often used when the checkbox represents a partial selection. For example, in a nested (hierarchical) list, a parent checkbox can be indeterminate if some but not all sub-options are checked.
This is not a state the user directly selects but is calculated by the system.

---

## selection_status_do_&_dont 👈🤔

✅ **Do:** Use indeterminate state only for parent-child hierarchies where some children are selected.
❌ **Don't:** Allow users to manually set a checkbox to indeterminate state—it should be system-calculated only.

✅ **Do:** Automatically update parent checkbox state when children change (all selected → checked, none → unchecked, some → indeterminate).
❌ **Don't:** Pre-select checkboxes by default as this increases the chance users will miss the question.

✅ **Do:** Use `aria-checked="mixed"` for indeterminate state to communicate status to assistive technologies.
❌ **Don't:** Treat indeterminate as a third value—it is presentational only and doesn't affect submitted data.

✅ **Do:** Order options logically—alphabetically, most-to-least common, or by workflow sequence.
❌ **Don't:** Confuse users by mixing checkboxes and radio buttons in the same option group.

✅ **Do:** Add hint text like "Select all that apply" to clarify multiple selections are allowed.
❌ **Don't:** Assume the visual difference between checkboxes and radios is obvious to all users.

---

## Error

**`False`** Used when the checkbox is unchecked but required.
Example: user must agree to terms, but didn't check the box.

**`True`** Used when the checkbox is checked but still invalid.
Example: the selection conflicts with another field or fails validation.

---

## error_do_&_dont 👈🤔

✅ **Do:** Validate checkbox selections on form submission, not when the user moves away from the field.
❌ **Don't:** Use inline validation on blur—wait until the user attempts to proceed.

✅ **Do:** Communicate errors through multiple channels—color, icon, and descriptive text message.
❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on color to indicate errors as this fails accessibility requirements.

✅ **Do:** Use `aria-describedby` to associate error messages with checkboxes for screen reader users.
❌ **Don't:** Disable the submit button when checkboxes are incomplete—show validation errors instead.

✅ **Do:** Provide specific, actionable error messages like "Select if you agree to the terms of service."
❌ **Don't:** Use vague messages like "This field is required" without explaining what action is needed.

✅ **Do:** Add visually hidden "Error:" prefix before error messages for screen reader announcement.
❌ **Don't:** Use native HTML5 validation—implement custom validation with `novalidate` on form elements.

---

## Reverse

**`False`** This is the default layout of the component.
From left to right, the order of the elements is as follows: checkbox / text / icon.

**`True`** As its name suggests, this layout is the reversed mirror of the "Default" template.
From left to right, the order of the elements is as follows: icon / text / checkbox. This variant is necessary for RTL mode and certain mobile use cases.

---

## reverse_do_&_dont 👈🤔

✅ **Do:** Position checkboxes to the left of labels in LTR contexts for easier scanning and discovery.
❌ **Don't:** Hardcode left/right positioning—use logical CSS properties that respond to text direction.

✅ **Do:** Use the reverse layout for RTL languages where checkbox should appear on the right side.
❌ **Don't:** Mix checkbox positions (left and right of label) within the same interface or form.

✅ **Do:** Test checkbox groups thoroughly in RTL mode to verify proper label alignment and reading order.
❌ **Don't:** Assume checkbox-to-label visual relationships will automatically reverse correctly.

✅ **Do:** Use logical properties like `marginStart` and `marginEnd` instead of physical `margin-left/right`.
❌ **Don't:** Forget to verify indeterminate and error states display correctly in reverse/RTL layout.

✅ **Do:** Consider mobile use cases where reverse layout may improve thumb reachability on large screens.
❌ **Don't:** Use reverse layout inconsistently—apply it systematically based on language direction or device context.

---

## Other boolean options

**`Description`** It is possible to display or hide accompanying text for the main label.

**`Icon`** It is possible to display or hide an icon. If displayed, this option includes functionality to choose any Solaris icon.

**`Divider`** It is possible to display or hide a dividing element (line).

**`Error message`** In the context where the component is in its "Error" true option, the error message can be displayed.

---

## other_boolean_options_do_&_dont 👈🤔

✅ **Do:** Use description text to explain accepted values or provide additional context for complex options.
❌ **Don't:** Include links within description text—screen readers may not announce them as interactive.

✅ **Do:** Keep descriptions to a single short sentence without full stops for scannability.
❌ **Don't:** Truncate checkbox labels with ellipsis—allow text to wrap to a second line instead.

✅ **Do:** Use dividers to create logical groupings or implement "none of the above" exclusive options.
❌ **Don't:** Overuse dividers—they should separate meaningful groups, not every individual option.

✅ **Do:** Use icons sparingly to reinforce label meaning when visual distinction adds genuine value.
❌ **Don't:** Add icons purely for decoration—they should serve a clear communicative purpose.

✅ **Do:** Display error messages immediately below the affected checkbox using consistent positioning.
❌ **Don't:** Hide error messages until form submission if real-time feedback would help users.

# Specs

## States

**`Enabled`** The status of the checkbox before a user has interacted with it, or other content affects it.

**`Hover`** When a user places a pointing device over a checkbox, but has not yet taken action on it.

**`Focus`** When a user selects a checkbox via keyboard or voice command, but has not yet taken action on it.
Mirrors the "Hover" state but includes an additional border.

**`Pressed`** An intermediate state that communicates a user has taken action on a checkbox, and that it is in the process of navigating to a destination, triggering logic, or transmitting data.

**`Read only`** The checkbox is displayed in a specific state (selected or unselected), but the user cannot modify it.

**`Disabled`** Used to indicate an option that cannot be selected.

**`Skeleton`** Improves the perceived loading time by providing a visual cue of where checkbox will appear once fully loaded.
Uses the "Skeleton" component, variant "Security marge=True".

# Changelog

| Date | Number | Notes | Designer |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| Nov 7, 2025 | 2.4.0 | • A new Read-only variant has been added for the .Checkbox.Indicator component, supporting three states – Selected, Unselected, and Indeterminate. This variant introduces two new color tokens: • ouds/color/action/read-only-primary – used for the indicator (shape) • ouds/color/action/read-only-secondary – used for the stroke • The new Read-only variant has been integrated into the Read-only variant of both the Checkbox and Checkbox Itemcomponents. • We replaced the token in Error text container ouds-control-text-input-space-padding-block-top-helper-text with ouds-control-control-item-space-padding-block-top-error-text. • "Helper text" is now called "Description". | Anton Astafev |
| Oct 20, 2025 | 2.3.0 | • The "Selection status" variant has been restructured from six options (Selected / Selected error / Unselected / Unselected error / Indeterminate / Indeterminate error) into three base variants: → Selected → Unselected → Indeterminate • Each variant now includes a boolean property to control the Error state (Error = True/False). • The divider color is now functional in the Error state – it changes dynamically according to the component status. • The icon in the Error state is fixed to .Component/alert/important; its color changes together with the divider depending on the component's status. → The new token $control-control-item-size-error-icon is used for the icon size. → The new token $control-text-input-space-padding-inline-error-icon is used for the error icon container. 🆕 Both tokens are now available in the latest release of the Token Library 2.1.0. • Added Error text (from the Input component) – it follows the same padding-inline as control-item (16px) and uses → $control-text-input-space-padding-block-top-helper-text for block padding. By default, the Error text adapts automatically to match the component status: → Selected → displays the corresponding default error message for the selected state. → Unselected → displays the corresponding default error message for the unselected state. → Indeterminate → displays the corresponding default error message for the indeterminate state. • The "Read only" state has been updated to replace disabled control items with the Tag → Text only → Mutedcomponent: → Positive with label "Selected" → Negative with label "Unselected" → Caution with label "Indeterminate" • Harmonisation of spacing across the control-item family We've unified sizing tokens across the entire control-item family (previously they were defined per component) to align spacing with other control items such as Text input. Replacement note: instead of the single token padding inset 12, use the following tokens: → ouds/_control/control-item/space/padding-inline → 16 → ouds/_control/control-item/space/padding-block → 12 Additionally, for the control-item family: → ouds/_control/control-item/space/column-gap → 12 → ouds/_control/control-item/size/max-width → 480 | Anton Astafev |
| Sep 19, 2025 | 2.2.0 | • In the initial settings, the 'Divider' variant is now hidden. | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Jul 21, 2025 | 2.1.0 | • The name of the family to which this component belongs is changing: Input → Control. As a result, the token naming convention is being updated. • Following the renaming of the 'Control' category, the name of the token sub-family 'control-item' is now becoming 'item'." | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Fev 13, 2025 | 2.0.0 | • Restructuring the component to optimize its factoring. • Creation of the nested component ".CheckboxItem.Control." • The component is now divided into two distinct components: • Checkbox • Checkbox item | Maxime Tonnerre |
| Jan 17, 2025 | 1.0.0 | • Component creation | Maxime Tonnerre |
