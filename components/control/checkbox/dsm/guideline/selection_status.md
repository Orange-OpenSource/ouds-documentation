**`Selected`** Indicates that the user has selected the option.
This often corresponds to an action or validation.

**`Unselected`** By default, a checkbox is often in this state.
This state indicates that the user has not selected the associated option.

**`Indeterminate`** Often used when the checkbox represents a partial selection. For example, in a nested (hierarchical) list, a parent checkbox can be indeterminate if some but not all sub-options are checked.
This is not a state the user directly selects but is calculated by the system.
