A checkbox component is a user interface element used to allow the user to selection-control or deselection-control an option. It is commonly used in forms, web interfaces, or applications to capture multiple or single choices.

This component family is available in two variants:
* **Checkbox:** In this template, the component does not display any text or icon. This layout provides greater flexibility when creating other components that require a checkbox to be displayed.
* **Checkbox item:** In this template, the component displays multiple additional text elements and icon assets.
