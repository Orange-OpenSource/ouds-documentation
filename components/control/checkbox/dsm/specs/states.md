**`Enabled`** The status of the checkbox before a user has interacted with it, or other content affects it.

**`Hover`** When a user places a pointing device over a checkbox, but has not yet taken action on it.

**`Focus`** When a user selects a checkbox via keyboard or voice command, but has not yet taken action on it.
Mirrors the "Hover" state but includes an additional border.

**`Pressed`** An intermediate state that communicates a user has taken action on a checkbox, and that it is in the process of navigating to a destination, triggering logic, or transmitting data.

**`Read only`** The checkbox is displayed in a specific state (selected or unselected), but the user cannot modify it.

**`Disabled`** Used to indicate an option that cannot be selected.

**`Skeleton`** Improves the perceived loading time by providing a visual cue of where checkbox will appear once fully loaded.
Uses the "Skeleton" component, variant "Security marge=True".
