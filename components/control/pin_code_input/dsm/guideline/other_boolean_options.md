**Helper text** Supporting text conveys additional information about the input field, such as how it will be used. It should ideally only take up a single line, though may wrap to multiple lines if required, and be either persistently visible or visible only on focus.

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use helper text to provide context about code delivery (e.g., "Enter the 6-digit code sent to your phone").  
❌ **Don't:** Use helper text for information that should be in a label or that duplicates visible instructions elsewhere.

✅ **Do:** Keep helper text concise—ideally one line—to avoid cluttering the interface.  
❌ **Don't:** Write lengthy helper text that wraps multiple lines and competes with the primary input for attention.

✅ **Do:** Ensure helper text remains visible and readable in all states, including when the input is focused or in error.  
❌ **Don't:** Hide or obscure helper text when displaying error messages; show both when both are relevant.

✅ **Do:** Write helper text that adds value, such as timing information ("Code expires in 5 minutes") or delivery details.  
❌ **Don't:** Include placeholder-style hints in helper text that merely repeat the input's purpose without adding context.

✅ **Do:** Position helper text consistently below the input group across all instances of the PIN code input.  
❌ **Don't:** Place helper text in inconsistent locations that confuse users about which input it relates to.
