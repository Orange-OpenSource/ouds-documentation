## When not to Use

Avoid using this component when:

❌ Users need to enter alphanumeric codes that include letters, as this component is optimized for numeric-only input.

❌ The input is for general text entry like names, addresses, or messages where a standard text field is more appropriate.

❌ You need to collect sensitive information that shouldn't be displayed character-by-character, such as full passwords or credit card numbers.

❌ The verification process involves pattern recognition or gesture-based authentication rather than code entry.

❌ Users need to enter variable-length codes where the expected number of digits is unknown or flexible.
