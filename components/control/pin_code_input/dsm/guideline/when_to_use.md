## When to Use

Use the Pin Code Input component when you need to:

✅ Verify user identity through SMS, email, or authenticator app codes during login or sensitive operations.

✅ Collect numeric PINs for account security, payment authorization, or access control systems.

✅ Enable two-factor authentication workflows where users need to enter time-based or event-based verification codes.

✅ Implement password reset flows that require email or SMS verification before allowing password changes.

✅ Authenticate transactions in banking or financial applications where numeric codes provide additional security.
