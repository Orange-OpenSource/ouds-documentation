## What is it
The Pin Code Input component is a specialized numeric input field designed specifically for entering verification codes, PINs, and one-time passwords (OTPs). Unlike standard text inputs, it provides a segmented visual structure where each digit occupies its own distinct cell, creating a clear, focused interface for code entry. This component automatically manages digit progression, visual feedback for each character position, and supports various input methods including keyboard entry, paste operations, and auto-fill from SMS or authenticator apps. The structured layout makes it immediately clear how many digits are expected and which positions have been filled, significantly reducing entry errors and improving the user experience during security verification processes. It includes built-in error states for invalid codes and supports both filled and outlined visual styles to match different design systems.
