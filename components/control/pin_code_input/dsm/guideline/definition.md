A PIN code input is a specialised form field used to capture short, fixed-length numeric codes, typically for authentication or confirmation purposes, such as a 4, 6 or 8-digit personal identification number (PIN). It is commonly used in sensitive flows like login, verification, or transaction confirmation. It is often presented as a serie of individual input fields or boxes, each representing a single digit, to enhance readability and encourage accurate input. This component must support smooth keyboard navigation (automatic focus shift, backspace handling), and secure input masking if needed.
