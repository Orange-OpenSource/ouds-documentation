**PIN code input** is a UI element that allows to capture short, fixed-length numeric codes, typically for authentication or confirmation purposes, such as a four, six or height-digit personal identification number (PIN). PIN code input is presented as a series of individual input fields or boxes, each representing a single digit, to enhance readability and encourage accurate input, while supporting smooth keyboard navigation and secured input masking if needed.
