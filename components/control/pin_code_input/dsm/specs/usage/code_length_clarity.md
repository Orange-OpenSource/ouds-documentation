### Code Length Clarity
**Do:** Make the expected code length obvious through the number of visible cells and include helper text if needed, such as "Enter the 6-digit code sent to your phone."

**Don't:** Create ambiguity about how many digits are required or allow variable-length input without clear guidance.
