### Cell Spacing
**Do:** Maintain consistent spacing between cells (typically 8-12px) to clearly distinguish individual digit positions while keeping the component visually cohesive.

**Don't:** Place cells too close together where they appear as a single input field, or space them so far apart that they don't feel like a unified component.
