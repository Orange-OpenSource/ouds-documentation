### State

**Default**  
The standard appearance when the component is ready for input, with neutral colors indicating an inactive or partially-filled state.

**Focused**  
Applied to the currently active cell, displaying enhanced visual indicators (typically through border color, background change, or shadow) to show where the next digit will be entered.

**Filled**  
Indicates cells that contain entered digits, typically showing a different visual treatment to distinguish completed positions from empty ones.

**Error**  
Activated when an invalid code is submitted or validation fails, applying error colors (typically red) to all cells to clearly communicate the issue.

**Disabled**  
Renders the component in a non-interactive state with reduced opacity, used when code entry is temporarily unavailable or pending another action.
