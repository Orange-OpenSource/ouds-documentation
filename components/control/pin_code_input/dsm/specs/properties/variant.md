### Variant

**Filled**  
The default visual style featuring cells with background fills that provide clear definition between input positions. This variant works well on both light and dark backgrounds and offers strong visual hierarchy.

**Outlined**  
An alternative style using border-only cells without background fills, creating a lighter, more minimal appearance. This variant is ideal for designs requiring visual subtlety or when placed on colored backgrounds.
