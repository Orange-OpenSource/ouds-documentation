### Behavioral Properties

**Auto-focus on Mount**  
When enabled, automatically focuses the first input cell when the component appears, allowing users to immediately start typing without clicking.

**Auto-progression**  
Automatically moves focus to the next empty cell when a digit is entered, enabling rapid input without manual navigation.

**Auto-submit on Complete**  
Optionally triggers validation or form submission automatically when all cells are filled, streamlining the verification process.

**Paste Handling**  
Intelligently processes pasted content by extracting numeric characters and distributing them across cells, supporting auto-fill from SMS and password managers.

**Clear on Error**  
Optionally clears all cells when an error occurs, allowing users to re-enter the code cleanly rather than correcting individual digits.
