### Color Contrast

All text and interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements. Input cell borders must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent backgrounds for both filled and outlined variants. Text content within cells (entered digits) must meet 4.5:1 contrast for normal text or 3:1 for large text (18px+ regular or 14px+ bold). Placeholder indicators or empty cell backgrounds must provide sufficient contrast to be perceivable. Focus indicators must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio against both the cell background and the surrounding page background. Error states must not rely solely on colorâ€”red borders for errors must be accompanied by text messages and/or iconography. When using color to indicate states (focused, filled, error), ensure each state is distinguishable by at least one additional non-color characteristic (border width, icon, pattern). Test the component in both light and dark modes to ensure contrast requirements are met in all themes.
