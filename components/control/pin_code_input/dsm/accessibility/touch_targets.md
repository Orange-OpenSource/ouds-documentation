### Touch Targets

All interactive elements must meet minimum touch target size requirements for mobile accessibility. Each input cell should be at least 44x44 pixels (iOS standard) or 48x48 pixels (Android standard) to ensure comfortable touch interaction. Spacing between adjacent cells should be sufficient (minimum 8px) to prevent accidental taps on neighboring cells. On mobile devices, tapping any cell should bring up the numeric keyboard automatically with inputmode="numeric" or type="tel" on the input elements. The entire component should be positioned with adequate spacing from other interactive elements on the page (minimum 8px clearance) to prevent mis-taps. For tablet devices, consider slightly larger target sizes (48-52px) to accommodate stylus input. Touch targets should include visual feedback on tap (such as brief background color change) to confirm interaction.
