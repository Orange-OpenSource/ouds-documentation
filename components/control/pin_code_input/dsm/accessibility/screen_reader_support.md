### Screen Reader Support

Each input cell must be implemented as a proper form input element (input type="text" with inputmode="numeric") with semantic HTML ensuring native screen reader support. The component container should have a role="group" with an accessible name describing its purpose (e.g., "Verification code input"). Each individual cell must have an accessible label indicating its position, such as "Digit 1 of 6" using aria-label or aria-labelledby. When a digit is entered, screen readers should announce the entered value and automatically indicate focus has moved to the next cell. Error states must use aria-invalid="true" on affected cells with associated error messages linked via aria-describedby. Status messages (like "Code accepted" or "Invalid code") should be announced through ARIA live regions (aria-live="polite" for non-urgent messages, aria-live="assertive" for critical errors).
