### Keyboard Navigation

The component must support full keyboard accessibility with intuitive navigation between cells. Users should be able to tab into the component, which focuses the first empty cell (or first cell if all are empty). Arrow keys (Left/Right) should move focus between cells, allowing users to navigate freely to correct mistakes. Backspace should delete the current cell's content and move focus to the previous cell, while Delete should clear the current cell without moving focus. The Tab key should move focus out of the component to the next focusable element on the page. All focus indicators must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 against adjacent colors and be clearly visible, typically using a 2-3px outline or border highlight. When errors occur, focus should remain on or return to the first cell to allow easy re-entry.
