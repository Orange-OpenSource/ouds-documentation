### Error Handling

Error states must be communicated through multiple channels for accessibility. Visual changes alone (color shifts) are insufficientâ€”errors must be programmatically announced to screen readers using aria-live regions. Each input cell in error state should have aria-invalid="true" applied. A descriptive error message must appear below the component and be associated via aria-describedby on the input cells, with messages like "The code you entered is invalid. Please check your messages and try again." The error message element should have role="alert" or be within an element with aria-live="assertive" to ensure immediate announcement. Focus should return to the first input cell when an error occurs, allowing users to easily re-enter the code. Error messages should be persistent (not automatically dismissed) until the user begins correcting the input. Color contrast for error text must meet WCAG requirements (4.5:1 for normal text).
