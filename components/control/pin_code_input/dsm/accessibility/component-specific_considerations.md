### Component-Specific Considerations

The Pin Code Input has unique accessibility requirements beyond standard form inputs. Since it presents a single logical input split across multiple visual cells, screen readers must understand it as a unified code entry field rather than separate, unrelated inputs. Use role="group" on the container with a clear accessible name to establish this relationship. The component must handle auto-fill from SMS and authenticator apps accessibly—when a code is auto-populated, screen readers should announce "Code automatically entered" or similar confirmation. For security reasons, consider whether to implement masking (showing dots instead of numbers after entry)—if implemented, provide a "Show/Hide code" toggle that's keyboard accessible and properly announced. Time-limited codes should include accessible timer announcements ("Code expires in 30 seconds") without interrupting the input process. If the component includes a "Resend code" button, ensure it's keyboard accessible, has clear focus indication, and announces its state (disabled/enabled) and any cooldown periods ("Resend available in 30 seconds").
