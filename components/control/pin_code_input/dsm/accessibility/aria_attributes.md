### ARIA Attributes

The component requires several ARIA attributes for proper accessibility. The container must use role="group" with aria-labelledby pointing to the component's label element. Each input cell should include aria-label="Digit [X] of [Y]" to indicate position within the sequence. When in error state, cells must have aria-invalid="true" and aria-describedby pointing to the error message element's ID. If using helper text, associate it with the component using aria-describedby on the container. For auto-complete functionality, cells should include autocomplete="one-time-code" to enable browser/OS-level code detection from SMS. Status updates should use aria-live="polite" for general messages and aria-live="assertive" for critical errors, ensuring announcements don't interrupt current screen reader activity unnecessarily.
