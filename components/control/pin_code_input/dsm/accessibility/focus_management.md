### Focus Management

Focus must be managed programmatically throughout the interaction lifecycle. On component mount, if auto-focus is enabled, focus should move to the first input cell automatically. When a digit is entered, focus should automatically advance to the next empty cell. When Backspace is pressed, focus should move to the previous cell after clearing the current one. If users navigate with arrow keys, focus should move appropriately between cells. When validation occurs and an error is detected, focus should return to the first cell to allow easy re-entry of the complete code. Focus indicators must be clearly visible with sufficient contrast (minimum 3:1 ratio) and typically implemented as a 2-3px colored border or outline. Focus should never be trapped within the componentâ€”users must always be able to tab out to other page elements. When the component is disabled, it should not receive focus at all.
