### Fast checklist

**Minimize user effort (Must)**  
✅ **Do:** Auto-advance focus after each digit entry to reduce manual tabbing  
❌ **Don't:** Force users to manually tab between boxes, slowing the flow

**Guide with context (Should)**  
✅ **Do:** Show helper text indicating expected digit count before first interaction  
❌ **Don't:** Wait until error submission to explain format requirements

**Surface errors immediately (Must)**  
✅ **Do:** Validate on submission and display specific error messages with next steps  
❌ **Don't:** Show generic "Error" without indicating whether the issue is empty or incorrect input

**Support paste workflows (Should)**  
✅ **Do:** Allow pasting full codes from SMS/email, auto-distributing digits across boxes  
❌ **Don't:** Require manual digit-by-digit entry when users have codes ready to paste

**Maintain visual hierarchy (Optional)**  
✅ **Do:** Use outlined style sparingly in headers or filters to reduce visual weight  
❌ **Don't:** Mix filled and outlined styles within the same form section
