## Touch & Mobile

1. Provide touch targets ≥44×44px for each digit box with ≥8px spacing between boxes.
2. Use `inputmode="numeric"` to trigger the numeric keyboard on mobile devices.
3. Support paste gestures: long-press to paste full codes, auto-distributing digits across all boxes.
4. Ensure tap targets don't overlap; provide clear visual separation between digit boxes.
5. Support both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of functionality or layout breaking.
