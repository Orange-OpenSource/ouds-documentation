### Common Issues to Avoid

1. Missing `aria-invalid` or `aria-describedby` on digit inputs when error state is active.
2. Color-only error indication without accompanying text or icon.
3. Focus indicator contrast <3:1 or missing visible focus on keyboard navigation.
4. Paste functionality not working or requiring manual digit-by-digit entry.
5. Error messages not announced by screen readers or missing specific guidance on correction.
