### Quick Tests (≤5 minutes)

1. Keyboard-only: Tab to first box, type digits with auto-advance, use Backspace to correct, submit with Enter; visible focus indicators appear throughout.
2. Screen reader: Group label announces "Enter 6-digit verification code", each box announces "digit X of 6", error message reads "Verification failed. Check and enter the correct code" on submission.
3. Zoom to 200%: Digit boxes reflow without overlapping; all text and spacing remain readable and functional.
4. High-contrast/dark mode: Focus indicators, digit box borders, and error states remain perceivable with ≥3:1 contrast.
5. Touch device: Each digit box meets 44×44px target size; numeric keyboard opens automatically; paste from SMS distributes digits correctly.
