**`Enabled`** Default state: the input is ready for interaction.

**`Hover`** When the user hovers over the input field (without the dropdown being opened), the appearance of the element changes slightly to indicate interactivity.

**`Focus`** When the user clicks or tabs into the input field (without opening the dropdown), the field gains focus and applies specific visual styles.

**`Expanded`** When the user opens the dropdown menu to view options.

**`Loading`** Indicates that options are being loaded asynchronously.

**`Read only`** When the select input is in a read-only state, its value is visible, but the user cannot interact with it or change the selection.

**`Disabled`** The input cannot be interacted with (non clickable, can't receive focus, no hover effect) and its appearance indicates unavailability.

**`Skeleton`** Displays a placeholder UI while content is loading.
