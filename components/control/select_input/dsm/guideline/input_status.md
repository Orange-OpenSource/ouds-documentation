**`Empty`** By default, a select input is open with label, no input text, dropdown closed, and no helper text displayed below.

**`Filled`** The input text is the option selected by the user from the dropdown menu.

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use clear placeholder text in empty states to guide users on what type of selection is expected

❌ **Don't:** Leave empty states completely blank without labels or placeholders, causing user confusion

✅ **Do:** Provide meaningful placeholder text that describes the category of choices (e.g., "Select country")

❌ **Don't:** Use the first option as a placeholder disguised as a selectable value

✅ **Do:** Ensure filled states clearly display the full selected value or truncate gracefully with ellipsis

❌ **Don't:** Allow selected text to overflow outside the input container without proper truncation

✅ **Do:** Differentiate empty and filled states visually to help users quickly identify which fields need attention

❌ **Don't:** Use identical styling for empty and filled states that makes form progress unclear

✅ **Do:** Announce input status changes to screen readers when selections are made or cleared

❌ **Don't:** Remove the label when the input is filled, forcing users to remember what they selected
