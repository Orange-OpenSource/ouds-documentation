Conveys the nature or purpose of the select input field at a glance.

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use universally recognizable icons that clearly represent the input's purpose (e.g., location pin for country selection)

❌ **Don't:** Add decorative icons that don't enhance understanding or serve a functional purpose

✅ **Do:** Ensure leading icons have proper color contrast (3:1 minimum) against their background in all states

❌ **Don't:** Use leading icons inconsistently across similar input types, creating confusion about their meaning

✅ **Do:** Size leading icons appropriately (16-24px) to maintain visual balance with text and remain perceivable

❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on icon color to convey state changes; use additional visual indicators for accessibility

✅ **Do:** Test icon comprehension with users to verify they understand the icon's meaning without text labels

❌ **Don't:** Place leading icons so close to the input text that they interfere with readability or cause visual clutter

✅ **Do:** Make leading icons purely visual and exclude them from the accessibility tree unless they convey unique information

❌ **Don't:** Use overly complex or detailed icons that become unclear when rendered at small sizes
