**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and a visible bottom border.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and visible stroke.

This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
* When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
* In a header (search field)
* In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog
