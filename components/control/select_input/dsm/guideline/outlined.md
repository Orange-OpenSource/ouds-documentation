**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and visible stroke.

This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
• When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
• In a header (search field)
• In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use outlined style for inputs in non-form contexts like toolbars, headers, or filters where visual weight needs to be minimal

❌ **Don't:** Mix outlined and filled styles inconsistently within the same form or interface section

✅ **Do:** Choose outlined style when the input sits on colored or textured backgrounds where filled inputs might clash

❌ **Don't:** Use outlined style as the default for long multi-field forms where filled inputs provide better visual structure

✅ **Do:** Ensure outlined inputs maintain sufficient contrast ratios (3:1 minimum) against their background in all states

❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on the border to convey interactive affordance without proper focus indicators

✅ **Do:** Test outlined inputs with users who have low vision to ensure the borders are perceivable in all states

❌ **Don't:** Use outlined style when multiple inputs are stacked vertically without sufficient spacing, as borders may visually merge

✅ **Do:** Apply outlined style consistently across filtering and search interfaces for cohesive visual language

❌ **Don't:** Use outlined inputs in contexts where users expect traditional form styling, causing confusion
