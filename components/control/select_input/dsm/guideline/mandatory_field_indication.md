**If all fields are mandatory (several fields present):**
1. Display the message "All fields are mandatory." at the top.
2. Do not use an asterisk (*) at the end of each field label, nor the word "mandatory."
UI rendering of the asterisk: font-weight-bold + color-content-negative (red).

**If not all fields are mandatory (several fields present):**
1. Display the message "All fields marked with an * are mandatory." at the top.
2. Use an asterisk (*) at the end of each mandatory field label (the word "mandatory" is read aloud instead of the visible asterisk at the end of the label).
UI rendering of the asterisk: font-weight-bold + color-content-negative (red).
3. Use the mention "(optional)" at the end of each optional field label. Note that this rule is not systematic—it remains an option, to be used if needed.

**If there is only one field in the form, or if the mandatory nature is obvious (such as login/password), no mention is necessary since the fields are essential to the form's functionality.**
