**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border, creating a softer and more contained look. Best suited for dense layouts or to enhance visibility.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and a visible stroke outlining the field.

This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
• When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
• In a header (search field)
• In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use outlined style on light backgrounds where the stroke provides sufficient visual boundary and contrast.  
❌ **Don't:** Use outlined style on busy or patterned backgrounds where the thin border may become visually lost.

✅ **Do:** Apply filled style in dense form layouts where multiple inputs need clear visual separation.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix outlined and filled styles inconsistently within the same form section.

✅ **Do:** Consider outlined style for inline or embedded inputs that should feel integrated with surrounding content.  
❌ **Don't:** Use outlined style for critical data entry where maximum visibility is required.

✅ **Do:** Maintain consistent style choice across all phone number inputs within the same user flow.  
❌ **Don't:** Switch between outlined and filled based solely on aesthetic preference without considering usability.

✅ **Do:** Test both styles for sufficient contrast ratios (minimum 3:1) against their backgrounds.  
❌ **Don't:** Assume one style works universally across all themes (light/dark mode).
