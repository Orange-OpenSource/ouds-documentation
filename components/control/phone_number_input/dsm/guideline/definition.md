Phone number Input is a UI element that allows to capture and validate telephone numbers, in international format. Phone number Input integrates a country selector, allowing users to choose their country and automatically apply the corresponding dialing code (such as +33 for France). Dialing code is displayed as a non-editable prefix within the field to guide the user and ensure consistent formatting. Real-time formatting or masking is included to improve readability during input, and validation rules tailored to the number structure of the selected country.
