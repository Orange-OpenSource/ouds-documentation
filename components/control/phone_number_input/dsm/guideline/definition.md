A phone number input is a form field specifically designed to capture and validate telephone numbers, often in international format. It typically integrates a country selector, allowing users to choose their country and automatically apply the corresponding dialing code (such as +33 for France).

The dialing code is usually displayed as a non-editable prefix within the field to guide the user and ensure consistent formatting. The component include real-time formatting or masking to improve readability during input, and validation rules tailored to the number structure of the selected country.
