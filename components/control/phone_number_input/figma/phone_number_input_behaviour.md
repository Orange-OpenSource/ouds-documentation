# Phone number input - Behavior

### ⚠️ Label

Describes the purpose of the input. Why hide a phone number input label?

In some UI contexts, especially when space is limited or when the input is part of a compact layout (search bars, filters, inline forms), visually hiding the label can help maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.

However, hiding the label should only be done if:
• The purpose of the input remains clear thanks to a placeholder or contextual icon.
• The label is still accessible to screen readers (using aria-label, aria-labelledby, or visually hidden text).

Hiding a label is a design choice that must balance visual simplicity and clarity of intent, without compromising inclusiveness or form guidance.

### ⚠️ Mandatory field indication

**If all fields are mandatory (several fields present):**
1. Display the message "All fields are mandatory." at the top.
2. Do not use an asterisk (*) at the end of each field label, nor the word "mandatory."
   UI rendering of the asterisk: font-weight-bold + color-content-negative (red).

**If not all fields are mandatory (several fields present):**
1. Display the message "All fields marked with an * are mandatory." at the top.
2. Use an asterisk (*) at the end of each mandatory field label (the word "mandatory" is read aloud instead of the visible asterisk at the end of the label).
   UI rendering of the asterisk: font-weight-bold + color-content-negative (red).
3. Use the mention "(optional)" at the end of each optional field label. Note that this rule is not systematic—it remains an option, to be used if needed.

**If there is only one field in the form, or if the mandatory nature is obvious (such as login/password), no mention is necessary since the fields are essential to the form's functionality.**
