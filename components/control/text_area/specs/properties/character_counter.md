### Character counter

**Character limit not exceeded**
The character counter, located in the helper text area, displays in real time (with each keystroke) the number of characters the user can still enter before reaching the field's allowed limit.

⚠️ It is impossible to provide a recommendation for the maximum number of characters, as this depends too specifically on the constraints (or lack thereof) of each project.

**Character limit exceeded**
If the user exceeds the set limit, the field enters an error state, but input is not blocked. The character counter then shows the user, still in real time, how many characters have been entered beyond the field's allowed limit.

The user must reduce the number of characters entered for the text area to exit the error state.
