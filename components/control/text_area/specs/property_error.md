### Error

The Error status indicates that the user input does not meet validation rules, for example, in this specific case, if the number of characters entered by the user exceeds the allowed limit. It provides immediate visual feedback, typically through a red border, error icon, and a clear, accessible error message positioned below the input.

This state helps users quickly identify and correct mistakes by explaining what went wrong and, when possible, how to fix it. The input remains editable, encouraging users to revise their input without starting over.

**⚠️ Error message vs helper text / link**

If a helper text accompanies the text input, it is replaced by the error message. However, a helper link must not be replaced and should remain positioned below the error message.
