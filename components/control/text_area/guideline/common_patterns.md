## Common Patterns

**Feedback and Review Forms**
Text areas are commonly used in customer feedback forms, product reviews, or survey responses where users need to share detailed opinions or experiences. The automatic expansion feature allows users to write as much as they need without being constrained by a small initial field, while the character counter helps them stay within reasonable limits. The error state provides clear guidance when responses are too long, ensuring submissions meet system requirements.

**Comment and Discussion Threads**
In social platforms, support tickets, or collaborative tools, text areas facilitate conversation by providing space for thoughtful replies and detailed explanations. The multi-line format encourages more comprehensive responses than single-line inputs, while the scrollable behavior at maximum height keeps the interface manageable even in lengthy discussions. The helper text can guide tone or content expectations, improving communication quality.

**Form Applications and Submissions**
Application forms for jobs, grants, or registrations often require detailed text entries for questions like "Why are you interested?" or "Describe your experience." Text areas in these contexts provide the necessary space for thoughtful responses while the character counter ensures applicants meet minimum or maximum length requirements. The outlined variant can be used in lighter-weight filtering interfaces, while the filled variant works well in traditional form layouts where multiple fields are stacked vertically.
