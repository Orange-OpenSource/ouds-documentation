## When to Use

✅ When users need to provide detailed, open-ended responses that require multiple sentences or paragraphs, such as feedback forms, comment sections, or message composition

✅ For collecting descriptions, explanations, or narratives where content length is unpredictable and may vary significantly between users

✅ When implementing forms that require validation with character limits, where real-time feedback on remaining characters improves user experience

✅ In scenarios where content may need to be reviewed or edited after initial entry, benefiting from the expanded viewing area

✅ When you need to differentiate longer text inputs from single-line fields in a form, making the interface more intuitive and reducing user confusion
