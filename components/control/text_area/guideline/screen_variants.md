## Screen Variants

**Desktop**
On desktop screens, the text area displays with optimal spacing and typically shows the default 3-line height (72px) initially. The component can comfortably expand to the maximum height of 240px (approximately 10 lines) before introducing a scrollbar. The larger viewport allows for generous padding around the field, clear visibility of helper text and character counters, and easy mouse interaction with the scrollbar when content overflows. Labels, helper text, and error messages have ample space and remain fully visible without wrapping.

**Tablet**
For tablet devices, the text area maintains similar functionality to desktop but may require slightly adjusted spacing to optimize for touch interaction. The component should maintain adequate tap target sizes (minimum 44x44px for interactive elements), and the scrollbar should be touch-friendly with sufficient width for finger scrolling. Consider the orientation: in portrait mode, the text area might occupy more vertical screen space, while landscape mode provides more horizontal room. Helper text and character counters remain visible but may wrap to multiple lines if necessary.

**Mobile**
On mobile devices, the text area requires careful consideration of the limited screen real estate. The component should span the full width of the container with appropriate margins to prevent edge-to-edge placement. The initial 3-line height is maintained, but be aware that vertical expansion can quickly consume valuable screen space. When the maximum height is reached and scrolling is introduced, users may encounter a scroll-within-scroll situation (text area scrolling within page scrolling), which can be challenging. Ensure the keyboard doesn't obscure the field when focused, and consider using the system's native scrolling behavior. Labels may appear above the field, and helper text should remain concise to avoid excessive scrolling. Touch targets for any interactive elements (like helper links) must meet minimum size requirements for comfortable thumb interaction.
