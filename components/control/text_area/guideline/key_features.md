## Key Features

**Multi-line text entry**
Allows users to input extended content across multiple lines, making it suitable for detailed responses, comments, and descriptions.

**Auto-resize capability**
Automatically expands vertically as users type, starting from 3 lines (72px) and growing up to 10 lines (240px) to accommodate content without manual adjustment.

**Character limit feedback**
Displays real-time character count in the helper text area, showing remaining or exceeded characters to help users stay within defined limits.

**Scrolling behavior**
When maximum height is reached, an internal scrollbar appears to allow navigation through overflowing text while maintaining a consistent layout.
