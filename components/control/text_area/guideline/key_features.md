## Key Features

**Multi-line Input Capability**
Unlike single-line text inputs, the text area supports multiple lines of text, making it ideal for longer content entries such as comments, descriptions, or messages.

**Automatic Height Expansion**
The component automatically expands vertically as users type beyond the initial 3-line display, accommodating growing content up to a maximum of 10 lines (240px) before introducing a scrollbar.

**Real-time Character Counter**
Provides immediate feedback on character usage, displaying remaining characters before reaching the limit and showing excess characters when the limit is exceeded, helping users stay within constraints.

**Flexible Visual Styles**
Offers both filled and outlined variants with optional rounded corners, allowing adaptation to different design contexts from dense forms to lightweight search interfaces.

**Comprehensive State Management**
Supports multiple interaction states including enabled, hover, focus, loading, read-only, disabled, and error states, with clear visual feedback for each condition.
