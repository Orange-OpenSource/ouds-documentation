## When not to Use

Avoid using this component when:

❌ A single-line text input would suffice for short, predictable responses like names, emails, or phone numbers.

❌ You need structured data entry that would be better served by specific input types like date pickers, dropdowns, or number fields.

❌ The expected input is so brief that a text area's vertical space would create unnecessary visual weight in the layout.

❌ You're building a rich text editor with formatting capabilities, which requires a more advanced component with toolbar controls.

❌ Space is extremely limited and a compact input solution is required, such as inline editing or search fields..
