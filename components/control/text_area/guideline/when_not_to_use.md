## When not to Use

❌ For short, single-line inputs like names, email addresses, or search queries where a standard text input would be more appropriate and space-efficient

❌ In highly constrained mobile layouts where the expanded height could disrupt the overall page flow or create awkward scrolling experiences

❌ When collecting structured data that would be better served by specific input types like dropdowns, radio buttons, or formatted fields (phone numbers, dates)

❌ For extremely long-form content creation where a dedicated rich text editor with formatting capabilities would provide a better authoring experience

❌ In read-only contexts where content simply needs to be displayed rather than edited, where a standard text display would be more appropriate
