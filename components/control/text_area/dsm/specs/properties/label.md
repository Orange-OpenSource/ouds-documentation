### Label

Describes the purpose of the input. Why hide a text area label? In some UI contexts, especially when space is limited or when the input is part of a compact layout (search bars, filters, inline forms), visually hiding the label can help maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.

However, hiding the label should only be done if:
• The purpose of the input remains clear thanks to a placeholder or contextual icon.
• The label is still accessible to screen readers (using aria-label, aria-labelledby, or visually hidden text).

Hiding a label is a design choice that must balance visual simplicity and clarity of intent, without compromising inclusiveness or form guidance.
