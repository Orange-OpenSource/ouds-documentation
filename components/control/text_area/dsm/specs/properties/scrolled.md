### Scrolled

**`Scrolled`** Represents the state in which the field contains more text than its visible height can display and that internal scrolling is available. This allows users to navigate through the overflowing text without expanding the text area beyond the maximum planned height of 240px, allowing the display of about 10 lines of text. It is particularly useful when preserving space is important, or when the text area is embedded within a fixed-height container.
