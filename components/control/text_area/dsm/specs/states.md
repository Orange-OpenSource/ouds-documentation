**`Enabled`** Neutral appearance, whether empty or filled. It allows users to click, focus, and type freely without restrictions.

**`Hover`** Slight visual contrast or border color change.

**`Focus`** The text area is focused and ready to receive user input. It visually highlights the field to indicate that it's currently editable and interactive. This state typically appears after a user clicks or taps into the field.

**`Loading`** The Loading state indicates that the system is processing or retrieving data related to the text area. A progress indicator appears to inform the user that an action is in progress. During this state, the input may be temporarily disabled to prevent further interaction.

**`Read only`** Text visible but not editable (often with a muted or different background).

**`Disabled`** The field is non-interactive and grayed out to indicate it cannot be changed. The helper text is muted.

**`Skeleton`** Improves the perceived loading time by providing a visual cue of where field will appear once fully loaded. Uses the "Skeleton" component, variant "Security marge=False".
