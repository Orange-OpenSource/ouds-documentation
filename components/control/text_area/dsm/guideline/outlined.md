**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border, creating a softer and more contained look. Best suited for dense layouts or to enhance visibility.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and a visible stroke outlining the field. This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
• When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
• In a header (search field)
• In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog

**Do & don'ts**

✅ **Do:** Use filled text areas in dense forms where multiple fields need clear visual separation and containment

❌ **Don't:** Mix outlined and filled styles within the same form context as it creates visual inconsistency

✅ **Do:** Choose outlined text areas for lightweight contexts like search fields or filtering interfaces where minimal visual weight is desired

❌ **Don't:** Use outlined text areas on backgrounds with poor contrast as the stroke may become difficult to perceive

✅ **Do:** Consider the overall page hierarchy when selecting outlined versus filled, ensuring text areas don't compete with primary actions

❌ **Don't:** Apply outlined style to all text areas by default without considering the specific use case and surrounding interface elements

✅ **Do:** Use filled text areas when the field needs to stand out as an important data collection point

❌ **Don't:** Switch between styles inconsistently across your application, as users expect predictable patterns

✅ **Do:** Test both styles with your target users to determine which provides better usability in your specific context

❌ **Don't:** Assume outlined text areas are always more modern or better; filled variants often provide clearer affordance for interaction
