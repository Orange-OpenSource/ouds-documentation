### Handle empty state meaningfully

✅ **Do:** Use placeholder text that shows realistic examples: "Example: I noticed the checkout button didn't respond when I clicked it on mobile"  
❌ **Don't:** Write vague placeholders like "Enter text here" or "Type something" that don't help users understand what to write
