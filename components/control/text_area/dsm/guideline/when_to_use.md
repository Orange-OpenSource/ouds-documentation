## When to Use

Use the Text Area component when you need to:

✅ Collect detailed, multi-line user input such as feedback, comments, descriptions, or messages.

✅ Allow users to express open-ended responses where single-line inputs would be too restrictive.

✅ Provide visible character limits with real-time feedback to help users stay within defined constraints.

✅ Accommodate variable content length with automatic expansion up to a defined maximum height.

✅ Display pre-filled content that users can review and edit in a read-only or enabled state.
