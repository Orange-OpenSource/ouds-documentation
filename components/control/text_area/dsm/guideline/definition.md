Text area is a UI element that allows to enter and edit longer blocks of text, such as comments, messages, or descriptions. Unlike a standard text input, which is limited to a single line, the text area can expand vertically and offers more space for content entry. It typically includes features like a visible label, placeholder text, character limits, and optional resize behavior. Text area is ideal for open-ended responses where users need to express detailed information.
