Text areas occupy full container width with maintained 72-240px height range. Character counters stack cleanly below input. Be mindful that internal scrolling combined with page scrolling can create usability challenges on smaller screens.

Vertical space is more constrained, so the 3-line initial height is critical. Consider viewport height when expanding to avoid pushing content entirely off-screen when keyboard appears.
