## What is it
A text area is a multi-line text area component that allows users to enter and edit longer blocks of text, such as comments, messages, or descriptions. Unlike a standard text area, which is limited to a single line, the text area can expand vertically and offers more space for content entry.

It typically includes features like a visible label, placeholder text, character limits, and optional resize behavior. The text area is ideal for open-ended responses where users need to express detailed information.
