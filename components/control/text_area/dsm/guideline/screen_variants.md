## Screen Variants

**Desktop**  
Text areas display with a default height of 72px (3 lines) and auto-expand up to 240px (10 lines) with clear visual indicators and ample space for helper text and character counts.

**Tablet**  
Similar behavior to desktop with adjusted touch targets and slightly modified spacing to accommodate touch interactions while maintaining readability.

**Mobile**  
Maintains the same height constraints but requires careful consideration of the scroll-within-scroll behavior when internal scrolling is active within the page scroll.
