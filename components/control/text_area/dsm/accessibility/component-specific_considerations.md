### Component-Specific Considerations
The auto-resize behavior from 3 to 10 lines must not cause unexpected scroll jumps or disorientation for users. Announce expansion behavior to screen reader users if it significantly changes the layout. The internal scrollbar that appears at maximum height creates a scroll-within-scroll situation, particularly problematic on mobileâ€”ensure this is tested with screen readers and touch gestures. When the scrolled state is active, the scrollable region must be keyboard accessible and announced. Character limit feedback must be real-time but not overly verbose; use `aria-live="polite"` to balance immediacy with non-interruption. The skeleton loading state should include appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-busy="true"` or `aria-live="polite"`) to inform users that content is loading. Ensure placeholder text is not relied upon as the sole labeling mechanism, as it disappears on input and may not be announced consistently.
