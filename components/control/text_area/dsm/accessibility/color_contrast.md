### Color Contrast
All text within and around the text area must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements: 4.5:1 for normal text (including labels, helper text, placeholder text, and input text) and 3:1 for large text. Error messages and error icons must maintain 4.5:1 contrast against their background. The focus indicator border must have at least 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors. In disabled state, text may have reduced contrast but should still be perceivable. Border colors, both in default and hover states, should meet 3:1 contrast for UI components. Ensure character counter text maintains 4.5:1 contrast in both normal and error states.
