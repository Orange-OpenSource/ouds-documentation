### Key Challenges
- Auto-resize behavior changing field height dynamically may disorient screen reader users who lose spatial context
- Character counters updating in real-time require live region announcements without interrupting text composition flow
- Scroll-within-scroll on mobile creates navigation complexity for users relying on gestures or screen readers
- Error states appearing after character limit exceeded must preserve all user content while providing clear recovery path
