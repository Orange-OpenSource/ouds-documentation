### Key Challenges
- **State communication**: Screen readers must announce character count changes, error states, and scrolling availability without overwhelming users with excessive updates
- **Focus management**: Multi-line editing requires clear focus indicators that remain visible as content expands and scrolls
- **Error recovery**: Users must understand not just that an error occurred, but exactly how many characters to remove and where the error message is located
- **Double-scroll conflict**: On mobile, nested scrolling (text area within page) creates confusion for screen reader and switch control users
