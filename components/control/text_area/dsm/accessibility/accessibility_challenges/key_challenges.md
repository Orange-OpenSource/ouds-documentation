### Key Challenges
- Character counters updating in real-time must announce changes without overwhelming screen reader users
- Auto-resize behavior can cause unexpected focus and scroll position changes that disorient users
- Error states with exceeded character limits must be communicated clearly without blocking input
- Scrollable content within text areas creates nested scrolling challenges on mobile devices
