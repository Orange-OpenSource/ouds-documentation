### Critical Success Factors
1. Provide programmatically associated labels, helper text, and error messages using `aria-describedby` (WCAG 3.3.2, 4.1.2)
2. Announce character count changes and limit violations via live regions without disrupting composition flow (WCAG 4.1.3)
3. Ensure all functionality operates via keyboard including multi-line navigation, scrolling, and error correction (WCAG 2.1.1)
4. Maintain ≥3:1 contrast for focus indicators, error borders, and disabled text states (WCAG 2.4.7, 1.4.11)
