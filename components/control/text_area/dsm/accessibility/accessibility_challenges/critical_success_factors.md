### Critical Success Factors
1. **Clear structure**: Proper semantic HTML with associated labels, described-by relationships linking to helper text, character counters, and error messages (WCAG 3.3.2, 4.1.2)
2. **Visible focus indicators**: High-contrast focus outlines (≥3:1) that remain visible throughout interaction (WCAG 2.4.7)
3. **Real-time feedback**: Polite ARIA live regions for character counter updates that don't interrupt user flow (WCAG 4.1.3)
4. **Keyboard accessibility**: Full keyboard operability including Tab navigation, arrow keys for text editing, and Escape to exit without submission (WCAG 2.1.1)
