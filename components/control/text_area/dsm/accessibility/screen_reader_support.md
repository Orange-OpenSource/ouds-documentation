### Screen Reader Support
The text area must use the semantic `<textarea>` HTML element to ensure proper identification by assistive technologies. Labels must be explicitly associated with the textarea using the `for` attribute matching the textarea's `id`, or by wrapping the textarea in a `<label>` element. Helper text should be associated using `aria-describedby` to provide context. Error messages must use `aria-describedby` or `aria-errormessage` to announce validation issues. Character count information should be announced dynamically using `aria-live="polite"` regions to inform users of remaining or exceeded characters without interrupting their input flow.
