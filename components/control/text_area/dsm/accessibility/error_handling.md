### Error Handling
Error messages must be semantically associated with the textarea using `aria-describedby` or `aria-errormessage` so screen readers announce them when the field receives focus. The `aria-invalid="true"` attribute must be added to the textarea element when in an error state. Error messages should clearly explain what went wrong (e.g., "Character limit exceeded by 45 characters") and how to fix it. Visual indicators include a red border, error icon, and red error text meeting color contrast requirements. Error announcements should use `aria-live="assertive"` for immediate validation issues or `aria-live="polite"` for less urgent feedback. The textarea must remain editable during error states to allow correction.
