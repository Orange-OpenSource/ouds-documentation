### Keyboard Navigation
Users must be able to navigate to the text area using the Tab key and enter it in the natural tab order of the form. Once focused, users should be able to type freely, with Enter creating new lines within the multi-line field. Shift+Tab should move focus backward. The focus indicator must have a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background. Arrow keys should navigate within the text content, and keyboard scrolling (Page Up/Page Down, Home/End) should work when internal scrolling is active.
