### Key Challenges
- **Label visibility vs. accessibility**: Hidden labels require correct ARIA implementation to remain discoverable by screen readers
- **Dynamic error communication**: Error messages must be programmatically associated and announced immediately without disrupting user flow
- **Multi-element coordination**: Leading icons, trailing actions, prefixes, and suffixes must not confuse assistive technology navigation
- **State change announcements**: Loading, validation, and autocompletion updates must be communicated via live regions without overwhelming users
