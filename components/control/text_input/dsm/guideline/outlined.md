**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border, creating a softer and more contained look. Best suited for dense layouts or to enhance visibility.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and a visible stroke outlining the field. This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
• When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
• In a header (search field)
• In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use the filled style (Outlined=False) as the default for standard forms to provide clear visual boundaries and better scannability.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix filled and outlined styles randomly within the same form—maintain visual consistency throughout.

✅ **Do:** Choose the outlined style for search fields in headers or navigation areas where inputs should feel lightweight.  
❌ **Don't:** Use outlined inputs in dense forms where the lack of fill may reduce visibility and field recognition.

✅ **Do:** Consider the background context when choosing styles—outlined works better on light backgrounds with sufficient contrast.  
❌ **Don't:** Place outlined inputs on busy or patterned backgrounds where the subtle borders may be hard to perceive.

✅ **Do:** Apply the same input style consistently within a given context (all form fields, all search bars).  
❌ **Don't:** Switch between outlined and filled variants for adjacent inputs without a clear design rationale.

✅ **Do:** Test both styles with your target users to determine which provides better affordance in your specific context.  
❌ **Don't:** Assume one style is universally better—context, brand, and user needs should drive the decision.
