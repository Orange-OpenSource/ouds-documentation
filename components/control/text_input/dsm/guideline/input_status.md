**`Empty`** The field is empty, showing only the label.

**`Empty (Placeholder)`** The field is empty but displays placeholder text to guide the user.

**`Filled`** The field contains user-entered text.

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Always provide a visible, persistent label for every text input—never rely solely on placeholder text.  
❌ **Don't:** Use placeholder text as a replacement for labels; it disappears when users start typing and harms accessibility.

✅ **Do:** Use placeholder text to provide format hints or examples (e.g., "e.g., john@example.com").  
❌ **Don't:** Put critical instructions in placeholder text—users cannot reference it once they've entered content.

✅ **Do:** Ensure filled inputs maintain clear visual distinction between the label and the entered value.  
❌ **Don't:** Use placeholder text color for entered values—maintain sufficient contrast for readability.

✅ **Do:** Design empty states to clearly invite interaction with appropriate visual affordances.  
❌ **Don't:** Make empty inputs appear disabled or non-interactive through overly subtle styling.

✅ **Do:** Consider pre-populating fields with known values when possible to save users time and reduce errors.  
❌ **Don't:** Auto-populate sensitive fields (like passwords) without explicit user consent and secure handling.
