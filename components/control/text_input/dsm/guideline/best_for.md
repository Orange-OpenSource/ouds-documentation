✅ Email, username, or password entry with appropriate input types and validation

✅ Search queries requiring quick, single-line input with optional autocomplete

✅ Forms requiring inline validation feedback as users type or on blur

✅ Situations where prefixes or suffixes help clarify expected format (currency, units)

✅ Contexts needing leading icons to indicate input purpose (search, email, phone)

✅ Cases where trailing actions enhance efficiency (clear field, show/hide password)

✅ Mobile-first scenarios where appropriate keyboard types improve data entry accuracy
