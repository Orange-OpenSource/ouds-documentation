Helps indicate the purpose of the input (magnifying glass for search, envelope for email, phone device for phone number). Only use a leading icon if it adds clear functional or contextual value.

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use universally recognized icons that clearly communicate the expected input type (magnifying glass for search).  
❌ **Don't:** Add decorative icons that don't provide functional or contextual value—they create visual noise.

✅ **Do:** Ensure leading icons have sufficient size (minimum 24dp) and contrast for easy recognition.  
❌ **Don't:** Use icons that compete visually with the input text or create crowding within the field.

✅ **Do:** Provide accessible names for icons using `aria-label` so screen readers can announce their purpose.  
❌ **Don't:** Assume icons alone convey meaning—always pair with labels for screen reader users.

✅ **Do:** Maintain consistent icon placement and sizing across all text inputs in your interface.  
❌ **Don't:** Vary icon styles (filled vs. outlined) inconsistently within the same form or context.

✅ **Do:** Consider whether the icon adds genuine value before including it—simpler is often better.  
❌ **Don't:** Overuse icons on every input; reserve them for cases where they meaningfully enhance comprehension.
