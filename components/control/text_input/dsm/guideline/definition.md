A text input is a user interface component that allows users to enter, edit, or select single-line textual data. It's one of the most fundamental form elements used to capture user input such as names, emails, passwords, or search queries. It provides a visual and interactive affordance for text entry while supporting labels, placeholders, icons, helper messages, and validation feedback.
