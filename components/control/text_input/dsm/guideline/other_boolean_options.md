**`Autocompletion`** Provides suggested values as the user types. Displays inline text predictions within the input field and/or a dropdown menu of predictive options to speed up input and reduce errors.

**`Prefix`** A visual or textual element placed before the user's input. Commonly used to indicate expected formatting like a country code, a unit...

**`Suffix`** An element placed after the user's input, often used to display a currency or a unit (kg, %, cm…).

**`Helper text`** Supporting text conveys additional information about the input field, such as how it will be used. It should ideally only take up a single line, though may wrap to multiple lines if required, and be either persistently visible or visible only on focus.

**`Helper link`** If the helper text is not sufficient (It can also be displayed on its own without helper text), it's possible to offer the user an additional help link (the link can be external or open a modal).
