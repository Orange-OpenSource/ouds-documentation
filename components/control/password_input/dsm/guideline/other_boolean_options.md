**Prefix** A visual or textual element placed before the user's input. A prefix is not common and is discouraged in a Password Input component. Here are illustrative examples of very specific cases where:
• "corp-" Company password enforcing a prefix
• "temp-" Temporary password during a testing phase
• "dev-" For test accounts
• "eu-, us-, prod-, stage-" To encode a target environment
• "test@" Used in the context of automated or predictable tests
• "admin-" Pattern used to define an admin password

**Helper text** Supporting text conveys additional information about the input field, such as how it will be used. It should ideally only take up a single line, though may wrap to multiple lines if required, and be either persistently visible or visible only on focus.
