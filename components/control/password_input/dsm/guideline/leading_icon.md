Helps indicate the purpose of the input (magnifying glass for search, envelope for email, phone device for phone number). Only use a leading icon if it adds clear functional or contextual value.

### Do & don'ts

✅ **Do:** Use universally recognized icons like a lock or key symbol that clearly communicate the password field's purpose.  
❌ **Don't:** Add decorative icons that don't contribute meaningful context or could confuse users about the field's function.

✅ **Do:** Ensure leading icons are marked as decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`) when the label already provides sufficient context.  
❌ **Don't:** Rely on the icon alone to communicate field purpose—always pair with a visible text label.

✅ **Do:** Maintain consistent icon sizing and alignment across all form inputs for visual coherence.  
❌ **Don't:** Use leading icons that visually compete with or obscure the show/hide toggle button on the trailing side.

✅ **Do:** Choose icon colors that meet 3:1 contrast requirements against the input background.  
❌ **Don't:** Use brand-colored icons that may fail contrast in certain themes or modes (light/dark).

✅ **Do:** Test that leading icons don't reduce the usable typing area or create cramped layouts on narrow viewports.  
❌ **Don't:** Include leading icons by default—only add them when they provide genuine functional value.
