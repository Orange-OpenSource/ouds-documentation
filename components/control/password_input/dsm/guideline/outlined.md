**`False`** An input with a subtle background fill and un visible bottom border, creating a softer and more contained look. Best suited for dense layouts or to enhance visibility.

**`True`** A minimalist input with a transparent background and a visible stroke outlining the field. This style may be interesting for contexts other than form pages:
* When inputs need to feel lightweight and unobtrusive
* In a header (search field)
* In a selection/filtering feature in a product catalog
