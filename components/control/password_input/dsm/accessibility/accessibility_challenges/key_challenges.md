### Key Challenges
- **Character masking** prevents visual verification of input, increasing error risk for users with visual or cognitive impairments
- **Password visibility toggles** must be discoverable and operable by all users regardless of input method
- **Error messages** need to provide specific, actionable guidance without exposing security vulnerabilities
- **Password requirements** must be communicated clearly before users attempt entry
