✅ **Do:** Use semantic status colors consistently throughout the application to establish clear visual language for users  
❌ **Don't:** Use red/negative status for non-critical information, as it creates unnecessary alarm and diminishes urgency perception

✅ **Do:** Reserve the Accent status for highlighting promotional or discovery-related counts that encourage exploration  
❌ **Don't:** Mix status meanings across contexts—a color should always represent the same semantic meaning

✅ **Do:** Use Neutral status as the default when the count doesn't require semantic emphasis or urgency  
❌ **Don't:** Overuse Warning or Negative statuses, as they lose impact when applied to non-urgent information

✅ **Do:** Apply Positive status to communicate successful completions, approvals, or beneficial counts  
❌ **Don't:** Use multiple different status colors in close proximity without clear contextual differentiation

✅ **Do:** Consider colorblind users by ensuring status meaning is conveyed through context, not color alone  
❌ **Don't:** Rely solely on status color to communicate critical information—pair with labels or icons when essential
