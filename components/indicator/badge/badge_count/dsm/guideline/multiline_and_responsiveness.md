**Multiline**
This component doesn't allows multi-line text editing. This is a design recommendation, technically, and for several reasons (responsive behavior, user zoom, etc.), multiline remains possible.

**Max-width vs full-width vs maximum count**
For greater flexibility, this component doesn't have a max-width but the badge must not display numbers greater than 99 (above 99, the label becomes +99.
It is not possible to set this component to use the full available width (of the screen or the container).

**User zoom in/out**
The behavior of the text during user zoom in/out must follow a fundamental principle: the text must remain readable, accessible, and must never break the structure or lose information.
- The text must always scale proportionally with user zoom. Text resizing must never be blocked.
- Zooming must never cause text to be truncated or hidden. The component must expand vertically to allow line wrapping.
- The component's height and width must be flexible, never fixed, in order to automatically adapt its dimensions according to the level of zoom.
- In order to preserve the minimun interactive area during user zoom out, this component have:
  - Large size: a min-width and a min-height **of 20px**
  - Medium size: a min-width and a min-height **of 16px**
- Even if, the component has a max-height or a max-width for resizing control purposes, technically, during user zoom in, these limitations are not fixed but must be scalable in order to adapt to the user's zoom level.
- In order to preserve a perfectly rounded appearance of the component, increasing the component's height (caused by increasing the text size) also proportionally increases its width.
