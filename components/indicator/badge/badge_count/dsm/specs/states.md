🚧 Missing from source: States section in badge_count_overview.md

Based on Figma component data, the Badge Count supports the following states:

**Enabled state**: The badge displays with full status color styling and readable count text. The contrast ratio between content and background meets the 4.5:1 minimum requirement.

**Disabled state**: The badge displays with a muted background color (`color-action-disabled`) and reduced contrast text (`color-content-on-action-disabled`), indicating the associated element or feature is unavailable.
