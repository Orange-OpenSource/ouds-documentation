The Badge is a small UI element used to highlight status, notifications, or categorization within an interface. It is often displayed as a label or indicator with a distinct background color and text.

**Usage:**
• Renders as a static label without a number.
Used for status indicators (e.g., "New", "Pending", "Success").
The size remains unchanged despite the increase in the interface size.
