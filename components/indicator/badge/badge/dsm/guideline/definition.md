The Badge is a small UI element used to highlight status, notifications, or categorization within an interface. It is often displayed as a label or indicator with a distinct background color and text. Badge is used for status indication (e.g., "New", "Pending", "Success"). Its size remains unchanged despite the increase in the interface size.
