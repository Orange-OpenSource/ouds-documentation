✅ **Do:** Use semantic colors consistently—green for positive outcomes, red for errors, blue for informational content, yellow for warnings.  
❌ **Don't:** Use random colors that don't align with established semantic meanings in your design system.

✅ **Do:** Reserve negative (red) status for critical issues requiring immediate attention like errors or failures.  
❌ **Don't:** Overuse negative status badges, which desensitizes users to actual critical information.

✅ **Do:** Use neutral status for general labels that don't carry semantic weight or emotional connotation.  
❌ **Don't:** Use neutral badges when a specific status color would better communicate the intended meaning.

✅ **Do:** Apply accent status to highlight new features, discoveries, or promotional content that needs emphasis.  
❌ **Don't:** Use accent badges for system status information where functional colors (positive, warning, negative) are more appropriate.

✅ **Do:** Use info status for non-urgent informational context like "In Progress" or "Pending Review".  
❌ **Don't:** Use info badges for states that require user action—use warning or negative instead.
