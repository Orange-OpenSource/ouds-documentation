✅ **Do:** Choose badge size proportional to the element it accompanies—use xsmall for icons, medium for standard UI components.  
❌ **Don't:** Use oversized badges that visually overpower the primary content they're meant to supplement.

✅ **Do:** Maintain consistent badge sizes within the same context or view for visual harmony.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix multiple badge sizes randomly within the same component or list.

✅ **Do:** Use larger badges (medium or large) when the badge conveys critical status information that must be noticed.  
❌ **Don't:** Use xsmall badges for important status information that users might easily miss.

✅ **Do:** Consider touch target requirements when badges appear in mobile or touch interfaces—ensure adequate size for accessibility.  
❌ **Don't:** Use xsmall badges as the only status indicator in touch-heavy interfaces without supporting context.

✅ **Do:** Scale badge size appropriately across responsive breakpoints while maintaining the fixed-size principle within each viewport.  
❌ **Don't:** Allow badges to dynamically resize based on interface scaling, which contradicts the component's design intent.
