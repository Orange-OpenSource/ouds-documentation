✅ **Do:** Use semantic colors consistently—green for positive outcomes, red for errors, yellow for warnings, blue for information
❌ **Don't:** Use semantic colors arbitrarily or swap their meanings across different contexts

✅ **Do:** Pair functional status badges (positive, warning, negative, info) with their designated functional icons
❌ **Don't:** Mix non-functional icons with functional status colors, as this breaks semantic meaning

✅ **Do:** Reserve the negative status for errors, restrictions, and truly critical information requiring immediate attention
❌ **Don't:** Overuse negative status badges for minor issues, which dilutes their impact

✅ **Do:** Use neutral status for general-purpose labeling where no specific semantic meaning is needed
❌ **Don't:** Use neutral status when a more specific semantic status would better communicate the meaning

✅ **Do:** Use accent status sparingly to highlight discovery or promotional content that stands out from standard statuses
❌ **Don't:** Use accent status as a substitute for positive status—they serve different purposes
