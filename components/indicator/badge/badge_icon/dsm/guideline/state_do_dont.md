✅ **Do:** Use the enabled state when the badge conveys actionable or current status information that users need to see
❌ **Don't:** Use the disabled state as the default—reserve it for genuinely unavailable or inactive contexts

✅ **Do:** Ensure disabled badges maintain sufficient contrast to remain visible while appearing subdued
❌ **Don't:** Hide important status information by using the disabled state when the status is still relevant

✅ **Do:** Pair the badge state with the state of the parent component it accompanies (e.g., disabled button = disabled badge)
❌ **Don't:** Show an enabled badge on a disabled component, creating visual inconsistency

✅ **Do:** Use consistent visual treatment across all disabled badge variants to maintain predictability
❌ **Don't:** Apply different disabled styles to different status types, as this creates confusion

✅ **Do:** Consider whether the badge should be visible at all when disabled—remove it if it adds no value
❌ **Don't:** Keep disabled badges visible when they provide no useful information to the user
