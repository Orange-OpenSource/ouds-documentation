**Security margin** Depending on the position of components in the Skeleton screen template, two variants are possible:
• If a margin (spacing) is present between two or more components, apply the version "Security margin=False" to the affected components.
• If no spacing is present between two or more components, apply the version "Security margin=True" to the affected components.

The "Security margin=True" variant includes transparent padding (with 0% opacity) at the top and bottom of the skeleton component. This padding prevents the creation of excessively large uniform surfaces, maintaining a visually balanced and structured layout.
