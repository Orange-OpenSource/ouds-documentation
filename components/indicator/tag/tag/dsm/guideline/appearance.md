**`Muted`** A tag with a subtle, light, or semi-transparent background. Used for secondary or less prominent information. Muted tags blend more with the background, providing a softer visual emphasis compared to emphasized tags.

**`Emphasized`** A tag with a solid, high-contrast background. Used to draw strong attention to important labels or categories. Emphasized tags stand out prominently against the interface and are ideal for primary or high-priority information.
