Tags have status depending on the context of the information they represent. Each state is designed to convey a specific meaning and ensure clarity in communication.

**Non fonctionnel** Non-functional tags are used to display categories, default states, or to draw attention without carrying a specific functional meaning (unlike functional tags such as success, info, warning, and error).
Icons related to the tag's context can be used to enhance recognition.

**`Neutral`** Default or inactive state. Used for standard labels, categories, or when no specific status needs to be communicated.

**`Accent`** Used to draw attention to new features, recommendations, or content suggestions. Invites users to explore and engage with new offerings, creating an exciting and engaging experience.

**Fonctional** Functional tags communicate specific statuses or system feedback (e.g., success, warning, error, information). Each tag must always be paired with its dedicated functional icon that matches the meaning of the tag.
**Other icons must not be used.**
