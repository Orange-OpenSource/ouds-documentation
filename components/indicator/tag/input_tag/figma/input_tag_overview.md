## Definition

A Input tag is a component that allows users to enter multiple values, each represented as a tag. As users type and submit values (usually by pressing enter, comma, or tab), each value is transformed into a Tag. Input tags are often used for adding labels, categories, or participants.

## States

**`Enabled`** The default state of the Input tag. The tag is fully interactive, allowing users to read the label and remove the tag if needed.

**`Hover`** Displayed when a user hovers the cursor over the tag. Visual cues (such as a highlighted border) indicate that the tag is interactive and can be removed.

**`Pressed`** Shown when the tag is actively being clicked or tapped. The tag appears pressed or highlighted, providing feedback that the action is being performed.

**`Disabled`** Indicates that the tag is non-interactive. The tag appears faded or greyed out, and users cannot interact with it or remove it.

**`Focus`** Appears when the tag is focused, typically via keyboard navigation or screen reader. A distinct outline or highlight indicates that the tag is in focus, supporting accessibility.

**`Skeleton`** A placeholder state displayed while content is loading. The tag appears as a simplified, greyed-out shape without label text, indicating to users that tags will soon be available.
