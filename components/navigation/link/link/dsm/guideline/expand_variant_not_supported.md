**Important! Following the design assessment ritual, the development of this subcomponent is on hold. A joint study with the future "Accordion" component will need to be conducted with the aim of unifying these two components.**

Similar to the "Button" component, a complementary "Expand" subcomponent is proposed.
This subcomponent adopts the layout and interaction states of the "Next" variant (text + chevron) with the following differences:
• Includes an "Active" state parameter for toggling between folded and unfolded states (boolean).
• The chevron icon for the folded state is "chevron down".
• The chevron icon for the unfolded state is "chevron up".
