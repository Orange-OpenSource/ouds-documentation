**`Text only`** Can be used for navigation or actions within the same page. Whether placed in a text paragraph or as a standalone component, the interaction states remain consistent.

**`Text + icon`** This option includes functionality to choose any Solaris icon.
Used for navigation or actions within the same page.
* When embedded in a text paragraph, its interaction states are the same as the "Text Only" variant.
* When used as a standalone component (e.g., like the "Next" variant), it adopts the same interaction states as the "Next" and "Back" variants.
* Typically utilized in business or back-office interfaces, it is rarely standalone (usually part of a group of elements).

**`Visited`** Indicates to the user that the target URL has already been opened on the device. The Visited variant is reserved for text links only, and even more so in a specific context, such as search results with suggested redirect links.
