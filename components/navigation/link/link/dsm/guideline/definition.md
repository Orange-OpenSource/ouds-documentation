A link is a user interface element that allows navigation from one location to another, either within the same page, across different pages of a site (or application), or to an external resource.

Typically rendered as underlined or styled text, a link communicates its interactive nature visually and semantically. It should always lead to a valid destination and be clearly labeled to describe the target or purpose. Unlike a button, which triggers an action, a link's primary function is navigation.
