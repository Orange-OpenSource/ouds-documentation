Links present unique accessibility challenges because they must be clearly distinguishable from surrounding text, provide meaningful context about their destination, and support multiple interaction methods including keyboard, touch, and assistive technologies.

### Key Challenges

- Differentiating links from regular text without relying solely on color
- Providing sufficient context for screen reader users navigating by link list
- Maintaining adequate touch targets for motor-impaired users on mobile
- Ensuring visited state changes don't reduce contrast below accessible thresholds

### Critical Success Factors

1. Link purpose must be determinable from link text alone or from context (WCAG 2.4.4)
2. Focus indicator must be visible with ≥3:1 contrast ratio against adjacent colors
3. Links must be keyboard operable without timing requirements
4. Programmatic role and state must be communicated to assistive technologies
