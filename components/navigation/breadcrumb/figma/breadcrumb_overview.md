## Drilldown

Breadcrumbs can be categorized into different levels based on their complexity and hierarchy.

**`N+1`** The first level beyond the home page.

**`N+2`** A subcategory or a more specific section.

**`N+3`** A deeper level of navigation, often product or content grouping.

**`N+4`** A more refined selection, like a product variant or article.
