**The Toolbar (aka Bottom app bar on Material 2)** is a bottom-anchored container dedicated to contextual actions and navigation within a given screen. It can host action icons, a navigation drawer icon, or a floating action button (FAB) cutout. It is used for tasks rather than top-level navigation.
