**The Navigation bar (aka Bottom navigation bar on Material 2)** provides access to an app’s primary destinations using 3 to 5 persistent tabs. Each destination is represented by an icon and optionally a text label. Positioned at the bottom of the screen, it supports quick switching between top-level sections, following Material Design navigation patterns.
