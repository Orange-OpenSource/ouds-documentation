✅ **Do:** Match the alert status variant (negative, positive, info, warning) to the semantic meaning of the message content  
❌ **Don't:** Use a positive (success) variant to display error messages or vice versa, as this confuses users

✅ **Do:** Use standardized, non-customizable icons for functional alerts (negative, positive, info, warning) to ensure consistent recognition  
❌ **Don't:** Replace or customize icons in functional alerts, as this breaks semantic conventions and reduces accessibility

✅ **Do:** Reserve accent variants for promotional or brand-driven highlights that engage users positively without system urgency  
❌ **Don't:** Use accent or decorative variants for critical system messages that require immediate user attention

✅ **Do:** Use the neutral variant for generic informational messages that don't carry semantic weight or urgency  
❌ **Don't:** Overuse colored status variants for messages that are purely informational, as this dilutes their impact

✅ **Do:** Ensure negative (error) alerts clearly indicate what went wrong and provide actionable next steps when possible  
❌ **Don't:** Display vague error messages without context or guidance on how to resolve the issue
