✅ **Do:** Always include semantic icons for functional alerts (negative, positive, info, warning) to ensure accessibility.  
❌ **Don't:** Remove icons from functional alerts, as users rely on visual cues to quickly identify severity.

✅ **Do:** Use icons for neutral and accent alerts only when they add meaningful context or recognition.  
❌ **Don't:** Add decorative icons that don't contribute to message comprehension.

✅ **Do:** Ensure icons have sufficient color contrast and are not the sole indicator of status (use color and text too).  
❌ **Don't:** Rely only on icon color to convey meaning, as this fails users with color blindness.

✅ **Do:** Keep icon size proportional to the alert's text size for visual balance.  
❌ **Don't:** Use oversized or undersized icons that create visual hierarchy issues.

✅ **Do:** Use consistent icon styles (filled vs. outlined) that match your design system's iconography guidelines.  
❌ **Don't:** Mix icon styles within the same alert or across similar alert types.
