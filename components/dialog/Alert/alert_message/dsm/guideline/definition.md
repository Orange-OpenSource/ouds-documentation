Alert Message is a functional, block-level alert used to display system feedback, status changes, or required actions. It includes a background, icon, semantic color, and may include a close button and/or action link. Unlike toast notifications, Alert Message does not disappear automatically and remains visible until dismissed or resolved. It is suitable for prominent, persistent, and actionable communication.
