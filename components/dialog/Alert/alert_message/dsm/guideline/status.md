**Non fonctionnel**
Non-functional alerts are informational or decorative. They provide context or highlight content without implying a specific state, system event, or user action. These alerts are not tied to UX patterns such as success, error, or warning, and may use contextual or brand-related icons to enhance recognition or storytelling.

**`Neutral`** Used as a generic informative alert without semantic meaning or colour association.
Suitable for a wide range of contexts – such as tips, general information, or descriptive labels – where no specific feedback or urgency is required.
Appropriate for help sections, dashboards, or onboarding flows.

**`Accent`** Uses brand colours to draw attention to promotional or highlighted information while remaining non-critical.
Ideal for marketing content, announcements, or feature highlights, where you want to subtly engage users without introducing functional semantics.
Ideal for promotional banners, product updates, or customer engagement moments.

**Fonctional**
Functional alerts communicate specific system statuses, results, or user feedback.
Each variant conveys a clear semantic meaning – such as success, warning, or error – and must always be paired with its dedicated functional icon to ensure clarity and accessibility.
Other icons should not be substituted, as the semantic pairing between icon, colour, and message is essential for recognition and consistency.

Use functional alerts to inform users about state changes, confirmations, or issues that are directly connected to system logic or user actions. These messages carry functional meaning and help guide user response or acknowledgment.

**`Negative`** Communicates a critical issue or error that prevents the user from proceeding until it is resolved.
These alerts remain visible until the problem is fixed or dismissed by the user.

**`Positive`** Indicates that a task or process has been completed successfully.
These alerts reassure users and confirm that no further action is needed.

**`Info`** Used to share neutral system information or service updates that do not require immediate action.
Ideal for background processes or status messages where users simply need to stay informed.

**`Warning`** Used to draw attention to potential issues or upcoming changes that might affect the user's service or experience.
Warnings encourage awareness but typically do not block actions.
