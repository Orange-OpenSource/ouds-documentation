**(for Neutral and Accent only)**
Alert messages can include an icon to enhance recognition or remain icon-free when visual simplicity is preferred.
Icons help communicate context and tone but are optional for Non-functional alerts (Neutral and Accent).

**⚠️ Note:**
Functional alerts (Negative, Positive, Info, Warning) must always include a dedicated functional icon that reflects their semantic meaning.
This ensures clarity, accessibility, and consistency across all user interfaces.

**`False`** Used when the alert should appear without an icon.
Recommended for minimalist layouts or when the message content is already self-explanatory.
Works well in neutral contexts where no additional visual cue is required.

**`True`** Used when the alert includes a decorative or contextual icon to support recognition or strengthen the visual identity.
Icons can vary depending on the alert's content – for example, informational, promotional, or illustrative.
