✅ **Do:** Keep description text to 1-2 short sentences maximum for optimal scannability.  
❌ **Don't:** Write lengthy paragraphs or "long-reads" within alert descriptions.

✅ **Do:** Omit description entirely if the label alone clearly conveys the complete message.  
❌ **Don't:** Add redundant description text that repeats what the label already states.

✅ **Do:** Provide actionable next steps when user action is required (e.g., "Check your settings").  
❌ **Don't:** Leave users without guidance when an error requires them to take corrective action.

✅ **Do:** Use plain, jargon-free language consistent with your brand's tone of voice.  
❌ **Don't:** Include technical error codes or developer-oriented messages in user-facing alerts.

✅ **Do:** Link to detailed information elsewhere if the message requires more explanation.  
❌ **Don't:** Overload the alert component with extensive details that belong on a separate page.
