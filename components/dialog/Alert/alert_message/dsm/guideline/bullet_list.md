Some alerts may include a bulleted list to present multiple related points or actions clearly, rather than a single sentence or paragraph.
This boolean option (True / False) controls whether the list is shown.

* Use a bullet list when you need to present multiple items that are of equal importance, not in a specific sequential order. For example: "You need to complete all of the following:" then a list. This follows the guidance from the U.S. Web Design System for bulleted lists (use unordered lists when order isn't important).

* Limit the number of items: if you have more than ~5-7 items, consider splitting the content or linking to a detailed page. Long lists reduce scannability. [design.va.gov+1](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Introduce the list with a lead-in sentence that contextualises the items (e.g., "You can do the following:" or "Please check these items:"). Don't start the list without context. [design.va.gov](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Each bullet item should be short, sentence fragment or brief statement, not full paragraphs. The goal is quick scanning. [design.cms.gov+1](https://design.cms.gov/components/alert/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Do not use a bullet list for only a single item; in that case, prefer a simple sentence.

**Guidelines**
* Use up to 3–5 bullet items for optimal readability.
* Each item should be concise and parallel in structure (start with the same part of speech).
* If more detail is needed, link to a page or modal instead of overloading the alert.
* Avoid combining bullet lists with multiple paragraphs – alerts should remain brief and focused.

**`False`** The alert displays a single concise message without additional listed content.
Use this state when one clear sentence (label or body text) is enough to convey the information.
Ideal for short, self-contained alerts such as confirmations or simple feedback messages.

**`True`** The alert includes a bullet list following the label (and optional body text).
Use this state when you need to highlight multiple points, such as service features, plan details, or next steps.
Each bullet should be short and written as a clear phrase or fragment – avoid long sentences or complex structures.
