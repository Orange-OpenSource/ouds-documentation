## When Not to Use

❌ For short, single-line inputs—use a text input component instead

❌ When input must follow a strict format—use constrained fields like date pickers or dropdowns

❌ For numeric data entry—use number input or stepper components

❌ When space is extremely limited and multi-line input is not practical
